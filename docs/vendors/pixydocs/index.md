# Pixydocs

Pixydocs is a SaaS-based IDP platform providing end-to-end document automation with custom neural network models and post-extraction workflow capabilities.

## Overview

Pixydocs provides an AI-driven workflow automation platform emphasizing flexibility and customization for document processing. Based in Lehi, Utah with 10 employees, the company focuses on automating not just data extraction but also post-extraction workflows. The platform builds custom machine learning models using neural networks for each project based on customer data. Pixydocs positions itself as addressing the most costly aspect of IDP: what customers do with extracted data after document processing. Customer testimonials report savings equivalent to two FTEs or $100,000 in the first 12 months.

## Key Features

- **Custom Neural Networks**: Project-specific machine learning models trained on customer data
- **End-to-End Automation**: Full workflow automation from document ingestion to post-extraction processing
- **Post-Extraction Workflows**: Emphasis on automating data handling after extraction
- **SaaS Deployment**: Cloud-based solution that adapts to processing volume needs
- **Quick Implementation**: Fast deployment compared to traditional IDP solutions
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable to specific business workflows and requirements

## Use Cases

### Business Process Automation with Data Handling
Companies implement Pixydocs for complete document-to-action workflows where extracted data triggers downstream processes. The platform not only extracts invoice data but also routes approvals, updates systems, and generates notifications based on custom business rules built into the workflow.

### Scalable Document Processing
Organizations use Pixydocs to handle variable document volumes without hiring additional staff. The SaaS platform scales processing capacity automatically, with one client reporting new business capability without adding two FTEs, saving $100,000 annually while maintaining service levels.

### Custom Industry Applications
Businesses with specialized document types deploy Pixydocs to build custom neural network models trained on their specific documents. The platform learns unique document layouts and data patterns, adapting extraction models to industry-specific requirements beyond standard templates.
