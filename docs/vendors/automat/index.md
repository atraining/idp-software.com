## Use Cases

### Insurance Claims Processing

Insurance companies use Automat to automate claims document processing across multiple legacy systems. The platform extracts data from claim forms and PDFs, populates information into Citrix-based claims systems, and routes documents through approval workflows. Automations are built from video demonstrations of the manual process, with deployment in days.

### Healthcare Patient Data Entry

Healthcare providers deploy Automat to automate patient intake and EHR data entry. The system processes patient forms, extracts information using AI, and enters data into Windows-based health information systems. HIPAA compliance controls ensure patient data security throughout the automation workflow.

### E-Commerce Order Processing

E-commerce businesses implement Automat to handle order fulfillment automation. The platform scrapes order data from web portals, extracts product information from documents, and populates shipping and inventory systems, reducing manual order processing time.
