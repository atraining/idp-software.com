## Overview

Skwiz provides [document extraction](../../capabilities/extraction/index.md) services using large language models including ChatGPT and custom models. The Brussels-based platform processes documents across accounting, HR, construction, and insurance sectors with language-agnostic capabilities. Skwiz supports invoices, passports, ID cards, driver's licenses, insurance claims, purchase orders, and delivery notes. The platform stores data within EU infrastructure with GDPR compliance. Originally launched in 2020 as a cloud invoice extraction API, the company rebuilt the platform around generative AI and relaunched in July 2023.

## Key Features

- **Generative AI Extraction**: Large language model-based data extraction from any document type
- **Document Classification**: Automated document type identification
- **PDF Splitting**: Separates multi-document PDF files
- **Signature Detection**: Identifies and extracts signature regions
- **Barcode Recognition**: Reads and decodes barcodes from documents

## Use Cases

### Accounts Payable Automation

Accounting departments use Skwiz to extract data from invoices in multiple languages and formats. The platform automatically [classifies](../../capabilities/classification/index.md) invoice types, extracts line items and totals, and exports structured data to accounting systems via API integration.

### HR and KYC Document Processing

Human resources teams process identity verification documents including passports, ID cards, and driver's licenses. The generative AI extracts personal information from international document formats without requiring training data for each document variant.

### Insurance Claims Management

Insurance companies automate claims processing by extracting data from claims forms and medical certificates. Skwiz detects signatures for validation, processes multi-page PDFs with splitting, and routes extracted information through approval workflows with data verification interfaces.
