## Use Cases

### Global Trade Document Compliance

Banks and trade finance institutions deploy SureMatch to automate letter of credit verification, bill of lading validation, and certificate of origin processing. The platform extracts shipment details, validates document consistency across multiple trade documents, flags discrepancies against compliance rules, and routes exceptions to trade specialists. Automated validation reduces manual review time by 80% while ensuring Incoterms and UCP 600 compliance.

### Banking KYC Automation

Financial institutions process customer onboarding documents including identity proofs, address verification, financial statements, and corporate registration certificates through SureXtract. The system extracts customer data, validates information against regulatory databases, performs sanctions screening, and populates core banking systems. Integration with existing workflows enables automated KYC updates and periodic customer due diligence reviews.

### Invoice and AP Automation

Enterprises automate accounts payable by processing vendor invoices across formats and languages. SURE's classification engine identifies invoice types, extraction modules capture header and line-item data, validation rules check purchase order matches, and SureFlow routes approvals through customized hierarchies. The platform integrates with ERP systems for automated posting and payment scheduling.
