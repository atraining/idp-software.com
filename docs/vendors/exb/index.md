## Use Cases

### Healthcare Patient Record Processing

Healthcare providers automate intake of patient documents including referrals, test results, insurance forms, and medical histories. ExB extracts patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, and insurance information from varied document formats submitted by physicians, labs, and patients. The platform handles handwritten notes and faxed documents, validating extracted data before feeding into electronic health record systems.

### Insurance Claims Automation

Insurance carriers process claims by extracting policyholder information, incident details, damage assessments, and supporting documentation from claim forms, police reports, repair estimates, and photos. The AI validates data consistency across documents, flags missing information, and routes claims to adjusters. The system adapts to different claim types and policy formats without template configuration.

### Manufacturing Order Processing

Manufacturers automate order confirmation processing by extracting product specifications, quantities, delivery dates, and pricing from customer emails and PDF order forms. ExB handles variations in customer order formats, validates against product catalogs and pricing agreements, and exports confirmed orders to ERP systems for production scheduling and fulfillment.
