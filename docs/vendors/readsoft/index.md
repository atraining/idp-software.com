## Use Cases

### Accounts Payable Automation

Finance departments implement ReadSoft solutions to transform their accounts payable operations. The system automatically captures incoming invoices from multiple channels (email, scan, EDI, supplier portals) and extracts key data including vendor information, invoice numbers, line items, tax amounts, and payment terms. Using machine learning, the technology recognizes varying invoice formats without requiring template setup for each vendor. Extracted data is validated against ERP master data and purchase orders, flagging discrepancies for review while routing clean invoices directly to approval workflows based on company policies. Integration with financial systems enables straight-through processing for matched invoices while maintaining a complete audit trail. This approach reduces invoice processing costs by up to 70%, accelerates processing time from weeks to days or hours, improves early payment discount capture, and enhances visibility into financial obligations and cash flow forecasting.

### Sales Order Processing

Order management teams utilize ReadSoft to streamline the handling of customer purchase orders. The solution captures orders received through various channels and automatically extracts customer information, product codes, quantities, pricing, and delivery requirements. The system validates this information against customer master data and product catalogs, identifying potential issues such as discontinued items or pricing discrepancies. Integration with ERP and CRM systems enables automatic order creation and customer communication, while workflow capabilities route exceptions to appropriate personnel for resolution. This implementation reduces order-to-cash cycle time by up to 60%, improves order accuracy through elimination of manual data entry, enhances customer satisfaction through faster order confirmation and fulfillment, and provides better visibility into order status throughout the process.
