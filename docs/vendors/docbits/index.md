# DocBits

DocBits is an AI-powered document processing platform from FELLOWPRO AG that extracts data from documents with claimed 96% accuracy using machine learning and OCR technology.

## Overview

Developed by FELLOWPRO AG in Poing, Germany, DocBits provides cloud-based intelligent document processing for enterprises. The platform processes structured, semi-structured, and unstructured documents across over 120 languages, extracting data at both header and line levels. DocBits employs AI swarm intelligence, where the system learns from input across multiple customer deployments to continuously improve [classification](../../capabilities/classification/index.md) and [extraction](../../capabilities/extraction/index.md) models. The solution integrates with ERP and CRM systems, with specialized connectors for Infor ERP environments.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Extraction**: Machine learning models combined with OCR extract data from PDFs, images, and scanned documents with claimed 96% accuracy across structured and unstructured formats
- **Multi-Language Support**: Processes documents in over 120 languages with language-agnostic recognition capabilities
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides unlimited document type support with custom extraction columns and volume handling without restrictions
- **ERP Integration**: Native connectors for Infor LN, Infor M3, and other ERP systems, plus integration with RPA platforms including UiPath, Blue Prism, and Automation Anywhere
- **Automated Workflows**: Configurable processing pipelines with validation rules, approval routing, and exception handling
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Hosted on secure German cloud infrastructure ensuring GDPR compliance and data residency requirements

## Use Cases

### Invoice Processing for Infor ERP Users
Organizations running Infor LN or M3 deploy DocBits to automate invoice workflows. The system captures invoices via email or upload, extracts vendor information and line items, validates against purchase orders in Infor, and posts directly to the ERP system. The Infor Business Context Model integration enables automatic matching of extracted data with existing master data, reducing manual validation.

### Multi-Language Document Extraction
International enterprises use DocBits to process documents across 120+ languages without template configuration. The platform automatically detects document language, applies appropriate OCR models, and extracts data using language-agnostic machine learning. Companies process invoices, purchase orders, and receipts from global suppliers without managing separate extraction rules per language.

### High-Volume Document Processing
Back-office operations deploy DocBits for processing large document volumes with scalable cloud infrastructure. The interactive dashboard provides real-time monitoring of processing queues, accuracy metrics, and exception cases. The AI swarm intelligence continuously improves accuracy as more documents flow through the system, reducing manual review requirements over time.
