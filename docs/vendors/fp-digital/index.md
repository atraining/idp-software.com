## Use Cases

### Digital Mailroom Implementation

Organizations implement FP DBS solutions to transform their traditional mailroom operations into efficient digital processes. The system captures incoming mail and documents through scanning hardware or digital channels, then applies intelligent recognition to classify documents by type and extract key information. Business rules automatically route digitized mail to appropriate recipients or departments based on content, urgency, or organizational structure. The platform maintains a complete audit trail of all document handling while providing secure access to authorized users regardless of location. This approach significantly reduces document processing time from days to hours, enables remote work capabilities by eliminating dependency on physical mail handling, improves tracking and visibility of communications, and enhances security through controlled access and encryption.

### Contract Management Automation

Legal departments and procurement teams utilize FP DBS to streamline their contract lifecycle management processes. The solution digitizes and processes contracts and supporting documentation, extracting key information such as parties, terms, values, and dates. The system implements configurable workflows that guide contracts through various stages including drafting, review, approval, execution, and renewal. Digital signature capabilities enable secure electronic signing while maintaining legal validity. The platform provides a centralized repository for all contracts with powerful search capabilities and automated alerts for important dates and milestones. This comprehensive approach accelerates contract processing by 65%, improves compliance through standardized procedures, enhances visibility into contractual obligations, and reduces risks associated with missed renewal dates or unmonitored terms.
