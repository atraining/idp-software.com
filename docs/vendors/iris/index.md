# IRIS (Canon Group)

IRIS (Image Recognition Integrated Systems) provides document capture, OCR, and document management solutions to help organizations digitize, recognize, and manage their documents.

## Overview

IRIS specializes in intelligent document recognition technologies that enable organizations to convert paper documents into digital formats, extract data, and manage information efficiently. As part of the Canon Group since 2013, IRIS combines its expertise in OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and document processing with Canon's imaging technologies to deliver comprehensive document capture and management solutions.

Founded in 1987 in Belgium, IRIS has developed a strong portfolio of document capture and processing software that addresses various needs from individual users to large enterprises. Their technologies are incorporated both into standalone products and embedded into Canon's hardware devices, creating end-to-end document workflow solutions.

IRIS serves diverse industries including legal, healthcare, government, finance, and education. Their solutions aim to help organizations reduce paper handling, automate data extraction, improve document accessibility, and streamline document-based processes.

## Use Cases

### Digital Mailroom Implementation

Organizations deploy IRIS solutions to transform physical mail processing into streamlined digital workflows. The system captures incoming mail through dedicated scanning hardware or multi-function devices equipped with IRIS technology. Advanced OCR extracts key information such as sender details, dates, and document types, while intelligent classification automatically categorizes documents based on content and structure. The digitized documents and extracted metadata are routed to appropriate recipients or business systems through configurable workflows. This approach significantly reduces manual handling, accelerates information delivery, improves tracking, and enables remote work capabilities by making mail content instantly available in digital format.

### Forms Processing Automation

Government agencies and enterprises implement IRIS technology to automate the processing of structured forms such as applications, surveys, and registration documents. The solution captures forms through batch scanning or digital submission channels, then applies advanced recognition to extract field data regardless of whether forms are typed, handwritten, or contain checkboxes and multiple-choice selections. Validation rules verify data accuracy and completeness, flagging exceptions for human review. The extracted information is exported to databases or line-of-business applications, eliminating manual data entry. This comprehensive approach improves processing speed, reduces errors, and allows staff to focus on higher-value tasks rather than routine data entry.
