The system extracts part numbers, quantities, and shipping information from documents in varying formats, routing data to ERP systems. Template-free processing handles supplier documents with different layouts without configuration, reducing procurement cycle times.

### Insurance Claims Processing
Insurance providers deploy Docketry for automated claims document handling. The platform processes claim forms, medical records, police reports, and damage assessments, extracting relevant information and detecting fraudulent submissions.
