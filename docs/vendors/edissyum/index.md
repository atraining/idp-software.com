## Use Cases

### Public Sector Mail Management

Local governments and administrations automate incoming mail processing by scanning paper correspondence, applying OCR for text recognition, and using AI to classify documents by department and type. The system automatically routes mail to appropriate officials, tracks response deadlines, and maintains audit trails for accountability. Integration with Maarch provides document lifecycle management from receipt through archiving.

### Administrative Document Registration

Government agencies streamline document registration workflows by capturing metadata through automated form recognition and validation. Open-Capture extracts key fields from applications, permits, and official forms, validates data completeness, and indexes documents for retrieval. The platform achieves 30-40% productivity improvement for document registration tasks when integrated with Maarch.

### Automated Invoice Processing

Organizations process vendor invoices by extracting header information, line items, and payment terms through LAD-RAD technology. The system validates extracted data against master records, flags exceptions for review, and exports approved invoices to financial systems for payment processing.
