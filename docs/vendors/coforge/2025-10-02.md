## News Review for coforge

# Coforge News Review

## Executive Summary

Coforge faced a volatile period marked by contrasting analyst endorsements and regulatory headwinds, with the company receiving multiple positive analyst ratings while simultaneously grappling with the impact of increased H-1B visa fees. CLSA initiated coverage with an "outperform" rating and Rs 2,346 target price representing over 50% upside potential ([NDTV Profit](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/coforge-shares-set-to-surge-50-in-12-months-clsa-initiates-coverage-with-outperform-rating)), while Motilal Oswal maintained the company as a top pick alongside Tech Mahindra for Q2 earnings ([NDTV Profit](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/research-reports/it-q2-results-preview-tech-mahindra-coforge-remains-motilal-oswals-top-pick-ahead-of-q2-earnings)). However, the company's stock experienced significant volatility, plunging 14% to become the worst performer in the BSE 500 index following the Trump administration's decision to increase H-1B visa application fees from $1,000 to $100,000 ([Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/market-bloodbath-440-of-bse-500-stocks-end-week-in-red-17-sink-in-double-digits-amid-it-pharma-rout/articleshow/124178016.cms)). Despite these challenges, Coforge demonstrated financial resilience with Q1 FY26 results showing 138% year-over-year EPS growth to Rs 9.49 and sequential profit growth of 21.5% to Rs 317 crore, though revenue missed consensus estimates ([Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/coforge-shares-rise-2-as-clsa-initiates-coverage-with-outperform-rating-51-upside-seen/articleshow/124226185.cms)). The company's strategic positioning as having reduced H-1B visa dependence over recent years, with approximately 35% reliance according to analyst estimates, provided some insulation from the regulatory changes compared to competitors with higher dependencies ([Live Mint](https://www.livemint.com/industry/new-contracts-work-from-india-variable-pay-tech-firms-h-1b-visa-us-trump-11758782418942.html)).

## Key Developments

**Analyst Coverage and Market Recognition**: CLSA initiated coverage on Coforge with an "outperform" rating and Rs 2,346 target price, projecting 15% revenue CAGR for FY26-28 and citing the company's position among India's top 10 IT firms with strong execution in financial services and travel verticals. Motilal Oswal Financial Services retained Coforge as a top pick for Q2 earnings alongside Tech Mahindra, while Dipan Mehta from Elixir Equities named the company among preferred midcap IT investment choices.

**Financial Performance**: Coforge reported Q1 FY26 consolidated net profit of Rs 317 crore, up 21.5% sequentially and 138.4% year-over-year, with revenue rising 8.2% quarter-on-quarter to Rs 3,689 crore. The company achieved EPS of Rs 9.49 compared to Rs 3.99 in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, positioning it among seven NSE midcap companies showing four consecutive quarters of EPS growth.

**Regulatory Impact**: The company faced stock volatility due to the Trump administration's H-1B visa fee increase to $100,000 per application, with Coforge maintaining approximately 35% reliance on H-1B visas for US operations according to analyst estimates. However, the company stated it has reduced H-1B dependence over recent years and expects minimal material impact from the policy changes.

## Market Context

Coforge operates within a challenging IT services landscape where midcap companies are positioned to benefit from smaller project opportunities that can deliver 10-13% growth on lower revenue bases compared to largecap competitors. The broader Indian IT sector faces margin pressures from pricing changes, delivery model shifts, and GenAI transition impacts, while regulatory headwinds from H-1B visa policy changes create additional operational cost considerations. Despite sector-wide challenges that have led to a 25% correction in IT stocks this year, analysts view midcap IT companies like Coforge as having advantages due to their ability to scale smaller projects and maintain management quality during turbulent market conditions.

## Notable Quotes

**Dipan Mehta, Director at Elixir Equities**: "Midcap IT companies have an edge because even smaller projects can deliver 10–13% growth on a low base. Their management quality and ability to scale in turbulent times stand out" ([Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/psu-banks-outshine-private-lenders-tata-elxsi-coforge-among-top-it-picks-dipan-mehta/articleshow/124247631.cms))

**Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President – Research, Axis Securities**: "They can look at some of the midcap IT companies rather than largecap IT because pressure is more on the largecap IT companies as they are catering more to US projects. So, pressure would be on largecap IT companies, but companies like Coforge and Mphasis from the midcap IT universe can be considered" ([Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/gst-led-consumption-boost-dabur-marico-trent-cement-names-look-promising-rajesh-palviya/articleshow/124060759.cms))

**Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical and Derivative Analyst, Angel One**: "Short term traders can take an exit. Expecting further weakness as previous support has been broken" ([NDTV Profit](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/buy-sell-or-hold-reliance-industries-tcs-trent-whirlpool-coforge-ask-profit))

## Strategic Implications

Coforge's strategic positioning as a midcap IT services company with reduced H-1B visa dependence and strong execution capabilities in niche verticals like financial services and travel provides competitive advantages during industry transitions. The company's proactive shift toward local hiring strategies and reduced reliance on H-1B visas positions it more favorably than competitors still heavily dependent on such programs, potentially providing resilience against future immigration policy changes. CLSA's projection of 15% revenue CAGR through FY28 suggests the company's vertical specialization strategy and partnerships with platforms like Duck Creek, Guidewire, Pega, and Mendix may drive sustained client growth despite sector-wide challenges. The company's ability to maintain strong financial performance with consecutive quarters of EPS growth while navigating regulatory headwinds indicates effective operational execution and market positioning within the competitive IT services landscape.
