## Use Cases

### Pharmaceutical Procurement Digitalization

Pharmaceutical companies implement source-to-pay platforms through Fluxym's consulting to digitize supplier interactions, purchase requisitions, and invoice workflows. Fluxym consultants analyze existing procurement processes, configure platform workflows matching company approval hierarchies, and integrate with SAP or Oracle ERP systems. The implementations enable electronic purchase orders, automated three-way matching, and supplier self-service portals.

### Enterprise Spend Management

Large enterprises deploy Coupa or SAP Ariba solutions with Fluxym's guidance to gain visibility into procurement spending across business units and geographies. Consultants configure catalog management for guided buying, establish contract repositories linking to purchase orders, and build analytics dashboards tracking spend by category and supplier. Integration with AP systems automates invoice receipt and payment processing.

### Supplier Onboarding and Management

Organizations streamline supplier relationship management by implementing platforms that centralize vendor information, qualification documents, and performance metrics. Fluxym configures supplier portals for document submission, automates compliance verification workflows, and establishes scorecards tracking delivery performance and quality metrics accessible to procurement teams.
