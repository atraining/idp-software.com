## Use Cases

### Mortgage Loan Processing Automation

Financial institutions implement Ephesoft to transform their mortgage loan processing operations. The solution captures loan applications and supporting documents from multiple channels including branch scanners, email attachments, and web portals. Intelligent classification automatically identifies more than 50 different document types common in mortgage packages, such as applications, tax returns, bank statements, and property appraisals. Advanced extraction technology retrieves key loan data including borrower information, property details, income verification, and credit history. The system validates extracted data against business rules and integrates with loan origination systems to populate applicant records without manual entry. This comprehensive approach reduces processing time from days to hours, improves data accuracy, ensures compliance through consistent processing, and enhances customer experience through faster loan decisions.

### Healthcare Records Management

Healthcare providers utilize Ephesoft to streamline the processing of patient medical records and administrative documents. The platform captures various healthcare documents including registration forms, insurance cards, referrals, lab results, and clinical notes. Machine learning algorithms classify these documents by type and extract critical patient information such as demographics, insurance details, medical record numbers, and diagnostic codes. The solution integrates with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems and practice management applications to automatically update patient records with the captured information. This approach significantly reduces administrative workload for healthcare staff, minimizes data entry errors, improves records accessibility for clinicians, and enhances billing accuracy. The solution also supports healthcare compliance requirements by ensuring consistent processing and maintaining detailed audit trails.
