## Products

### Video Redaction

VIDIZMO Redactor's video redaction capabilities provide comprehensive tools for obscuring sensitive visual and audio information in video content. The solution can automatically detect and redact faces, license plates, weapons, and other objects throughout video footage, maintaining consistent redaction as objects move across frames [[2]](https://slashdot.org/software/comparison/Reduct-Video-vs-VIDIZMO-Redactor/). This is particularly valuable for law enforcement agencies processing body camera footage, surveillance videos, and other evidence that may contain identifiable information about minors, victims, witnesses, or bystanders. The platform supports various redaction styles including blurring, pixelation, and solid masks to accommodate different privacy requirements. Audio redaction capabilities allow for the removal of spoken sensitive information, names, or other identifiable verbal content. The system can process videos from multiple sources including body cameras, CCTV systems, interview recordings, and submitted evidence, making it a versatile solution for organizations dealing with diverse video content requiring privacy protection.

### Document Redaction

VIDIZMO Redactor's document processing capabilities enable the automated identification and redaction of sensitive information within text documents, PDFs, forms, and scanned materials. The solution employs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to detect text in scanned documents and images, ensuring that even non-digital text can be properly identified and redacted [[3]](https://redactor.ai/blog/document-redaction-tool). Pattern recognition features automatically identify specific data structures such as social security numbers, credit card information, phone numbers, and addresses based on their formatting patterns. The platform supports batch processing of multiple documents simultaneously, significantly reducing the time required for large-scale redaction projects. Document redaction can be applied to various file types including PDFs, Microsoft Office documents, image files containing text, and scanned paperwork. This comprehensive approach ensures that all sensitive information is properly protected regardless of the document format, making the solution particularly valuable for organizations processing large volumes of documentation containing PII or other confidential information.

### Audio Redaction

VIDIZMO Redactor's audio processing capabilities focus on the identification and removal of sensitive spoken information in audio recordings. The system uses advanced speech recognition technology to transcribe audio content and identify potentially sensitive information within the spoken word [[4]](https://help.vidizmo.com/support/solutions/articles/17000141363-configuring-vidizmo-audio-indexer-for-pii-detection-and-redaction). AI-powered detection can automatically identify personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, identification numbers, and other sensitive details mentioned in conversations. Once detected, the system can apply various redaction methods including beeping, silence, or audio distortion to obscure the sensitive content while preserving the context and clarity of the remaining audio. This capability is particularly valuable for organizations processing call center recordings, interview audio, meeting recordings, and other spoken content that may contain confidential information. The solution helps ensure compliance with privacy regulations while maintaining the usability and context of the audio content for legitimate business, legal, or administrative purposes.

## Use Cases

### Law Enforcement Evidence Redaction

Law enforcement agencies implement VIDIZMO Redactor to process body camera footage, surveillance videos, and other digital evidence while protecting sensitive information. The system automatically identifies and redacts faces of minors, victims, witnesses, and bystanders in video evidence to protect their privacy and comply with legal requirements. License plate information, house numbers, and other identifying details are detected and obscured using AI-powered recognition. Audio redaction capabilities remove spoken names, addresses, and other personal information from interview recordings and 911 calls. The solution supports batch processing of large evidence volumes, significantly reducing the time officers spend on manual redaction. Integration with evidence management systems creates a streamlined workflow from capture to court presentation. This implementation enhances privacy protection for individuals captured in evidence, ensures compliance with disclosure regulations and privacy laws, reduces the administrative burden on officers and staff, and accelerates the preparation of evidence for court proceedings or public records requests.

### FOIA Request Processing

Government agencies utilize VIDIZMO Redactor to efficiently respond to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests while protecting exempt information. The system automatically identifies and redacts personal privacy information such as names, addresses, and identification numbers from requested documents, videos, and audio recordings [[5]](https://redactor.ai/blog/foia-redaction-software). Law enforcement sensitive information including investigation techniques, informant identities, and operational details are detected and obscured based on preconfigured patterns and rules. Confidential business information and trade secrets submitted to government agencies receive appropriate protection through automated identification and redaction. The solution's bulk processing capabilities allow agencies to handle large-volume FOIA requests efficiently while maintaining consistent redaction standards. Comprehensive audit trails document all redaction decisions for potential legal review. This approach improves response time to FOIA requests through automation, ensures consistent application of exemption criteria across all materials, reduces the risk of accidental disclosure of protected information, and provides defensible documentation of the redaction process.

### Healthcare Data Protection

Healthcare organizations implement VIDIZMO Redactor to protect patient privacy while sharing medical information for legitimate purposes. The system automatically identifies and redacts protected health information (PHI) such as patient names, medical record numbers, and dates of birth from documents, images, and videos in compliance with HIPAA requirements. Medical images including X-rays, MRIs, and photographs are processed to remove identifying patient information while preserving clinically relevant content. Video recordings of procedures, consultations, and telemedicine sessions are redacted to protect patient identities when used for education, quality improvement, or legal purposes. Transcribed medical dictations and notes undergo automated redaction to remove patient identifiers before sharing for research or administrative purposes. This implementation enhances HIPAA compliance through consistent PHI protection, facilitates appropriate information sharing for medical education and research, reduces the risk of privacy breaches and associated penalties, and allows more efficient use of medical information while maintaining patient confidentiality.
