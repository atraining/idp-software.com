# Sensible.so

Sensible is a developer-focused document processing platform offering API-based extraction services with LLM parsing and visual layout rules for converting unstructured documents into structured data.

## Overview

Sensible provides a [document processing](../../capabilities/document-understanding/index.md) API for developers to extract data from PDFs, emails, and spreadsheets. The platform offers 150+ pre-configured document parsers alongside custom configuration capabilities using LLM parsing and visual layout-based rules. Sensible supports development and production environments with versioning, webhooks, and SDKs for JavaScript and Python. The company operates on AWS infrastructure with multi-region deployment and enterprise-grade performance. Founded in San Francisco in 2020, Sensible raised $8M in funding led by Craft Ventures with participation from Engineering Capital and Clocktower Technology Ventures.

## Key Features

- **LLM Parsing**: Large language model-based document extraction for unstructured documents
- **Visual Layout Rules**: Layout-based extraction rules for structured document formats
- **Pre-Configured Parsers**: 150+ ready-to-use parsers for common document types
- **Document Classification**: Automatic document type identification
- **SDKs**: JavaScript and Python libraries for API integration
- **Webhooks**: Event-driven notifications for document processing workflows
- **Quality Monitoring**: Extraction quality tracking and analytics dashboard
- **Version Control**: Document parser versioning for configuration management

## Use Cases

### Financial Document Processing

Fintech companies integrate Sensible's API to extract data from bank statements, tax forms, and financial reports. The platform uses LLM parsing for variable document layouts and pre-configured parsers for standardized forms, with webhook notifications triggering downstream processing workflows.

### Healthcare Record Extraction

Healthcare applications use Sensible to process medical records, insurance forms, and patient documents. The HIPAA-compliant platform extracts structured data from clinical PDFs and integrates with electronic health record systems through REST API connections and Python SDKs.

### Business Automation

Enterprise applications automate invoice processing, contract analysis, and receipt [extraction](../../capabilities/extraction/index.md) through Sensible's API. Developers configure custom parsers using visual layout rules, monitor extraction quality through dashboards, and maintain parser versions across development and production environments.
