## Use Cases

### Banking Document Processing

Financial institutions implement Parascript's technology to automate the processing of complex banking documents. The solution automatically classifies incoming documents (loan applications, account forms, checks) and extracts critical information including customer details, account numbers, transaction amounts, and signatures without requiring pre-defined templates. Machine learning algorithms analyze handwritten entries with high accuracy, while signature verification capabilities authenticate customer authorizations. Integration with core banking systems enables straight-through processing for clean transactions while flagging exceptions for review. This approach reduces document processing costs by up to 80%, accelerates transaction processing from days to minutes, improves data accuracy through elimination of manual entry errors, and enhances fraud detection through sophisticated signature analysis and document authenticity verification.

### Healthcare Claims Processing

Healthcare organizations utilize Parascript to streamline claims processing and medical documentation handling. The system automatically processes diverse document types including claim forms, explanation of benefits documents, medical records, and supporting clinical documentation. Advanced recognition capabilities extract patient information, procedure codes, diagnostic information, and payment details regardless of form layout variations. The technology understands medical terminology and coding structures, enabling accurate mapping of extracted data to required fields. Built-in validation rules verify code combinations and identify potential compliance issues before submission. This implementation significantly reduces claims processing time from weeks to days, improves first-pass acceptance rates through more accurate submissions, reduces labor costs associated with manual review and data entry, and enhances compliance through consistent application of processing rules.
