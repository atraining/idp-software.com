## Use Cases

### Accounts Payable Automation

Organizations implement SoftCo solutions to transform their accounts payable operations. The platform captures incoming invoices through multiple channels (email, scan, EDI), automatically extracts header and line-item data, and validates this information against purchase orders and receiving documents. The system routes invoices through configurable approval workflows based on amount thresholds, cost centers, and exception conditions, while maintaining a complete audit trail for compliance purposes. Integration with ERP and accounting systems enables straight-through processing for matched invoices while providing real-time visibility into invoice status and payment timing. This approach reduces invoice processing costs by up to 80%, accelerates cycle times from weeks to days, improves supplier relationships through timely payments, and strengthens financial controls through consistent application of approval policies.

### Purchase-to-Pay Transformation

Financial departments utilize SoftCo technology to streamline the entire purchase-to-pay process. The solution manages requisition creation and approval, automates purchase order generation and distribution to suppliers, captures and processes supplier invoices, and facilitates payment execution. Built-in matching capabilities automatically reconcile invoices with purchase orders and receiving documents, identifying discrepancies for review. The supplier portal enables vendors to submit invoices electronically, check payment status, and update their information, reducing manual intervention and inquiry handling. Comprehensive analytics provide insights into spending patterns, supplier performance, and process efficiency. This implementation centralizes purchasing control, captures early payment discounts, improves spend visibility, and strengthens compliance with procurement policies while maintaining comprehensive audit trails for regulatory requirements.
