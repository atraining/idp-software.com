## Use Cases

### Property & Casualty Insurance Automation

Insurance carriers deploy Indico Data to automate commercial lines submissions, processing broker emails with policy applications, loss runs, certificates of insurance, and financial statements. The platform classifies document types, extracts risk information, validates data completeness, and routes to underwriting systems. Guidewire integration enables carriers to eliminate manual document intake bottlenecks, accelerating quote turnaround times while maintaining underwriting accuracy.

### Financial Services Document Processing

Banks and asset managers automate loan application processing by extracting data from tax returns, pay stubs, bank statements, and credit reports. Indico's transfer learning models adapt to institution-specific document formats with minimal training examples. Extracted financial data flows to loan origination systems for automated decisioning on consumer and commercial credit applications, reducing application processing time from days to hours.

### Healthcare Claims and Prior Authorization

Healthcare payers and providers process medical records, prior authorization requests, and claims attachments through Indico's intelligent intake platform. The system extracts diagnosis codes, procedure details, medical necessity justifications, and supporting clinical information. Automated extraction accelerates claims adjudication and prior authorization decisions while reducing manual review costs for administrative staff.
