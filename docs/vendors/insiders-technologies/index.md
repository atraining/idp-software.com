## Use Cases

### Purchase-to-Pay Automation

Enterprises deploy Insiders' 360° Invoice Management to automate end-to-end AP workflows from invoice receipt through payment. The system ingests invoices via email, EDI, portal uploads, or direct e-invoice formats, applies deep learning for header and line-item extraction, matches against purchase orders, routes exceptions through approval workflows, and posts to ERP systems. Support for ZUGFeRD and XRechnung enables compliance with German e-invoicing mandates while handling international vendor formats.

### Insurance Document Processing

Insurance carriers process new business applications, claims documentation, policy changes, and correspondence using cognitive automation. The platform's deep learning models extract policy details from broker submissions, classify document types within claims folders, and route information to appropriate workflow queues. Integration with policy administration systems enables straight-through processing for standard cases while flagging complex scenarios for underwriter review.

### Public Sector Digitization

Government agencies and municipalities automate citizen service requests, permit applications, and administrative correspondence. Insiders' platform processes incoming mail, emails, and web submissions, extracting applicant information, request types, and supporting documentation. Automated routing directs cases to appropriate departments while maintaining audit trails for transparency and compliance. The system handles German-language documents with high accuracy through DFKI-developed AI models.
