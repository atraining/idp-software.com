## Use Cases

### Financial Services Application Processing

Banks and financial institutions implement FormHero to transform complex application processes such as account opening, loan applications, and investment onboarding. The platform creates intelligent digital forms that adapt to each applicant's specific situation, displaying only relevant questions based on previous answers. For example, a mortgage application might follow different paths for first-time homebuyers versus investment property purchasers. Real-time integration with credit verification and identity services allows for immediate validation during the application process. The system automatically generates compliant documentation and seamlessly transfers application data to core banking systems. This comprehensive approach reduces application abandonment by 40%, decreases processing time from days to minutes, eliminates data entry errors, and ensures regulatory compliance through consistent processing.

### Insurance Claims Automation

Insurance companies utilize FormHero to streamline their claims submission and processing workflows. The solution provides policyholders with dynamic digital claim forms that adapt based on the type of claim, policy details, and specific circumstances of the incident. For example, an auto insurance claim form automatically adjusts to show relevant questions based on whether the incident involved a collision, theft, or weather damage. The platform guides claimants through the process of submitting necessary documentation, including the ability to upload photos and supporting evidence directly within the form. Integration with claims management systems ensures that all information is automatically transferred without manual re-entry. This approach improves customer satisfaction through a simplified claims experience, reduces processing time by eliminating paper handling and manual data entry, and improves accuracy by validating information at the point of submission.
