### Rossum Platform

The Rossum platform is a comprehensive solution for intelligent document processing that combines AI-powered data extraction with workflow automation. It features workspaces and document queues for organizing processing tasks, customizable business rules for validation and routing, and a Master Data Hub for maintaining reference data [[4]](https://rossum.ai/platform/). The platform's AI agents provide intelligent reasoning capabilities, enabling more sophisticated automation of document-related processes. Rossum's technology excels in accuracy compared to other data extraction solutions, targeting a 90% increase in document processing speed for users [[5]](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/intelligent-document-processing-solutions/vendor/rossum/product/rossum).

### AI OCR Solution

Rossum's AI OCR solution goes beyond traditional optical character recognition by incorporating cognitive capabilities that understand document context. Unlike conventional OCR, which typically requires templates for each document layout, Rossum's technology can recognize information in documents with layouts it has never seen before [[6]](https://rossum.ai/help/faq/). This out-of-the-box AI comes pre-trained to understand hundreds of thousands of invoice templates, ensuring highly accurate data extraction from day one while continuously improving through machine learning [[7]](https://rossum.ai/data-capture/).

### Rossum Aurora

Rossum Aurora is the company's advanced AI engine designed to manage all types of transactional documents. It handles invoices, purchase orders, bills of lading, goods receipt notices, certificates, and other business documents with high accuracy and efficiency [[8]](https://rossum.ai/solutions/technology/). Aurora represents the cutting edge of Rossum's intelligent document processing capabilities, incorporating the latest advancements in artificial intelligence to improve automation rates across diverse document types.

## Use Cases

### Automated Invoice Processing

Finance departments implement Rossum to streamline accounts payable operations. The system captures incoming invoices from multiple channels, including email attachments, supplier portals, and scanned documents. AI-powered data extraction automatically identifies and captures key invoice data such as header information, line items, tax amounts, and payment terms. Validation workflows allow for quick review of extracted data, with AI highlighting potential issues or discrepancies. Integration with ERP systems enables automated posting of validated invoice data to accounting systems. Approval workflows route invoices to appropriate stakeholders based on business rules. This implementation reduces manual data entry by up to 90%, accelerates invoice processing cycles from days to minutes, improves data accuracy through consistent extraction methodology, and enhances visibility through comprehensive processing analytics.

### Purchase Order Management

Procurement teams leverage Rossum to automate the processing of purchase orders and related documents. The system captures incoming purchase orders from suppliers and automatically extracts key information including order numbers, item details, quantities, and pricing. AI capabilities match purchase orders with corresponding invoices and goods receipts for three-way matching. Validation workflows enable quick verification of data accuracy and resolution of discrepancies. Integration with procurement systems ensures seamless data flow and process continuity. This approach accelerates order processing through automated data extraction, improves accuracy through intelligent matching algorithms, enhances supplier relationships through faster response times, and provides better visibility into procurement operations through centralized document management.

### Logistics Document Processing

Logistics and transportation companies implement Rossum to process shipping documents efficiently. The system captures and processes bills of lading, shipping manifests, customs declarations, and delivery notes from various sources. AI-powered extraction identifies key logistics data such as shipment details, container numbers, product information, and destination addresses. Validation workflows enable quick verification of critical information to ensure compliance and accuracy. Integration with transportation management systems ensures seamless data flow throughout the logistics chain. This implementation reduces document processing times by up to 74% as demonstrated by Evologics [[9]](https://rossum.ai/customer-stories/), improves data accuracy through consistent extraction methodology, enhances compliance through systematic document verification, and provides better visibility into shipment status through centralized document management.
