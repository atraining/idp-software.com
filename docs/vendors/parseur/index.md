## Use Cases

### Invoice Processing
Companies automate invoice data entry by forwarding supplier invoices to Parseur. The AI engine extracts invoice numbers, line items, totals, and due dates from various formats and layouts, then sends structured data to accounting systems via webhooks or spreadsheet integrations for payment processing.

### Lead Generation from Emails
Sales teams use Parseur's email parser to extract prospect information from inquiry emails and contact forms. The platform captures names, companies, phone numbers, and requirements from inbound messages, routing structured data to CRM systems through Zapier or direct API integration.

### Order Processing
E-commerce businesses automate order confirmation processing by parsing customer order emails. The text parsing engine extracts order numbers, product details, shipping addresses, and payment information, feeding data to fulfillment systems and spreadsheets for inventory management.
