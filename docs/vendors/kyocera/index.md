## Use Cases

### Enterprise Document Management

Organizations implement Kyocera's document management solutions to establish centralized control over business information and streamline document processes. The Kyocera Cloud Information Manager (KCIM) provides secure document storage with metadata tagging, version control, and permission-based access [[1]](https://www.kyoceradocumentsolutions.us/en/products/software/KYOCERACLOUDINFORMATIONMANAGER.html). Integration with Kyocera multifunction devices enables direct scanning to the repository with automated classification and indexing. Workflow capabilities automate document routing, approvals, and notifications based on document type and business rules. Mobile access allows employees to retrieve, review, and process documents from any location. This implementation creates a single source of truth for business documents, accelerates document retrieval through powerful search capabilities, enhances security through controlled access and audit trails, and facilitates remote work through cloud-based document accessibility.

### Managed Print Services Transformation

Organizations utilize Kyocera's Managed Document Services (MDS) to optimize their printing infrastructure and document workflows. The process begins with a comprehensive assessment of the current print environment, including device inventory, usage patterns, costs, and environmental impact. Based on this analysis, Kyocera implements an optimized fleet of devices with strategic placement and right-sizing for departmental needs. Print management software provides secure printing, usage tracking, and quota enforcement. Document workflow solutions digitize paper-intensive processes, replacing printing with electronic workflows where appropriate. Ongoing management includes proactive maintenance, supplies fulfillment, and continuous optimization. This approach reduces document-related costs through optimized infrastructure, enhances security through controlled access and tracking, improves sustainability through reduced waste and energy consumption, and increases productivity through streamlined document processes.
