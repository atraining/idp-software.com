## Overview

Kodak Alaris offers specialized hardware and software solutions designed to help businesses digitize, process, and manage documents and information. The company was formed in 2013 as part of a settlement agreement between Eastman Kodak Company and the UK Kodak Pension Plan (KPP), following Eastman Kodak's bankruptcy proceedings [[1]](https://www.allscan.co.za/7-news/front-page-news/27-kodak-announces-comprehensive-settlement-with-u-k-pension-plan/).

This unique formation saw the UK Kodak Pension Plan acquire several of Kodak's businesses to establish a new company, Kodak Alaris, which would generate income to help meet the pension obligations of KPP members. In 2020, ownership was transferred to the UK Pension Protection Fund (PPF), a government agency designed to protect pensioners [[2]](https://www.deep-analysis.net/kodak-alaris-free-at-last/). More recently, Kodak Alaris was acquired by Kingswood Capital Management from the United Kingdom Pension Protection Fund [[3]](https://www.lincolninternational.com/transactions/the-united-kingdom-pension-protection-fund-has-sold-kodak-alaris-to-kingswood-capital-management/).

Headquartered in Rochester, New York, with operations worldwide, Kodak Alaris focuses on document scanning, information management, and imaging solutions. The company has become a leader in document capture technology, with a comprehensive portfolio of scanners and software that cater to various business needs and industries.

Today, Kodak Alaris is structured primarily around two main divisions: Alaris, which handles hardware and software for digital imaging and information management; and Kodak Moments, which focuses on retail photo printing kiosks and the sales and marketing of traditional photographic film [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodak_Alaris).

Intelligent Document Protection technology prevents damage to original documents, which is crucial for legal compliance and customer service in financial environments. Automated data extraction identifies and captures key information from financial documents including personal details, account numbers, transaction amounts, and signatures, reducing manual keying and associated errors. Integration with core banking systems and customer relationship management platforms enables straight-through processing of captured information, updating customer records and initiating appropriate workflows. This implementation significantly accelerates account opening and loan processing times from days to hours through streamlined document capture and data extraction. It improves customer experience with faster service and reduced document handling requirements. The approach enhances regulatory compliance through consistent, auditable document capture and processing workflows. It also reduces operational costs associated with document handling, storage, and manual data entry.

### Healthcare Records Management

Healthcare providers implement Kodak Alaris scanning and information management solutions to digitize and manage patient records efficiently while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements. The system captures medical documents from various sources including patient intake forms, referrals, test results, and historical records, creating comprehensive electronic patient files. Distributed capture capabilities enable document scanning at various points of service including registration desks, nursing stations, and medical records departments, reducing document transportation and processing delays. High-quality image capture ensures the legibility of critical medical information including handwritten notes, charts, and diagnostic images, which is essential for proper patient care. Automated indexing links captured documents to the correct patient records through barcode recognition, OCR of patient identifiers, or integration with electronic health record systems. Secure integration with electronic health record (EHR) systems makes digitized documents immediately available to authorized healthcare providers through their familiar clinical interfaces. This approach dramatically improves access to patient information by making complete medical records available electronically from any authorized location. It enhances patient care through more comprehensive information access during consultations and treatment planning. The implementation strengthens compliance with records management regulations including HIPAA through consistent, secure document handling processes. It also reduces physical storage costs and space requirements by transitioning from paper to electronic records.

### Government Document Management

Government agencies at federal, state, and local levels implement Kodak Alaris solutions to manage the large volumes of documents required for constituent services, internal operations, and regulatory compliance. The system processes diverse document types including applications, forms, correspondence, identification documents, and supporting materials, handling both current processing and backfile conversion of historical records. High-volume production scanning capabilities efficiently digitize large document backlogs and ongoing paper submissions, addressing the substantial document volumes typical in government operations. Intelligent document classification automatically identifies document types and routes them to appropriate processing workflows, accelerating handling while ensuring proper procedures are followed. Security features protect sensitive information through encryption, access controls, and audit trails that maintain chain of custody and comply with government information security requirements. Integration with case management systems and government databases enables automatic updating of constituent records and initiation of appropriate service workflows based on captured information. This implementation significantly improves constituent service through faster document processing and reduced waiting times for government services. It enhances transparency and accountability with better tracking of documents throughout their lifecycle. The approach increases operational efficiency by reducing manual document handling and physical storage requirements. It also strengthens disaster recovery capabilities by securing critical information in digital format with appropriate backup systems.
