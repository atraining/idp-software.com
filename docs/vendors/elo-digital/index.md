## Use Cases

### Contract Lifecycle Management

Legal and procurement teams manage contracts from creation through renewal by storing signed agreements in the ELO repository with automated metadata extraction. The system tracks contract milestones, sends renewal reminders, and maintains version histories. Role-based access ensures only authorized personnel view sensitive contract terms while audit trails track all document access.

### Invoice and AP Automation

Accounting departments process vendor invoices by capturing documents via email, scan, or portal upload. ELO's AI extracts invoice data, validates against purchase orders, routes for approval workflows, and archives processed invoices with retention policies. Integration with SAP or Datev systems enables automatic posting to financial ledgers.

### HR Records Management

Human resources departments digitize and manage employee files including applications, contracts, performance reviews, and benefits documentation. The platform enforces access restrictions based on HR roles, manages retention schedules according to labor regulations, and provides audit-proof archiving for compliance requirements.
