## Products

### Invoice OCR API

Mindee's Invoice OCR API provides comprehensive capabilities for automatically extracting key information from invoice documents with high accuracy and speed. The solution processes various invoice formats from different vendors, extracting critical information including invoice numbers, dates, due dates, vendor details, line items, totals, tax information, and payment terms without requiring template configuration for each supplier [[4]](https://www.mindee.com/product/invoice-ocr-api). Advanced deep learning models understand the structure of invoices regardless of layout variations, ensuring consistent extraction across different formats and styles. Multi-language support enables processing of invoices in various languages, maintaining high accuracy across international documents. Integration capabilities allow seamless connection with accounting systems, ERP platforms, and procurement solutions through RESTful APIs and SDK options for various programming languages. The system delivers extracted data in structured JSON format for easy integration into downstream business processes. By implementing the Invoice OCR API, organizations can dramatically reduce manual data entry costs, accelerate invoice processing times from days to minutes, improve data accuracy through consistent AI-powered extraction, and scale operations efficiently without proportional staffing increases [[5]](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/invoice-ocr).

### Receipt OCR API

Mindee's Receipt OCR API leverages advanced deep learning to automatically extract essential details from receipts with high accuracy and speed. The solution processes various receipt formats including paper receipts, digital receipts, and expense reports, capturing key information such as merchant details, transaction date and time, total amount, tax information, payment method, line items, and category information [[6]](https://www.mindee.com/product/receipt-ocr-api). Specialized receipt recognition models understand the unique structure and variations of receipts from different merchants and countries, ensuring consistent extraction regardless of format differences. Mobile-optimized processing handles images captured by smartphone cameras, compensating for common issues like poor lighting, skewed angles, and image quality variations. Integration options include RESTful APIs and SDKs for various programming languages, enabling seamless connection with expense management systems, accounting software, and financial applications. The system delivers extracted data in structured JSON format for easy integration into expense reporting and accounting workflows. By implementing the Receipt OCR API, organizations can significantly improve expense management efficiency, reduce manual data entry requirements for employees and finance teams, accelerate reimbursement processes through faster receipt processing, and improve expense compliance through consistent data capture and categorization [[7]](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/receipt-ocr).

### docTI Custom Document Processing

Mindee's docTI platform provides organizations with the ability to create custom document processing APIs tailored to their specific document types without requiring machine learning expertise or extensive data preparation. The solution enables quick creation of custom extraction models for organization-specific documents such as specialized forms, proprietary documents, industry-specific paperwork, or unique report formats [[8]](https://www.mindee.com/platform/docti-custom-document-processing-apis). The innovative approach requires minimal setup with no data model training, allowing businesses to generate custom APIs by simply uploading a few sample documents and defining the fields to be extracted. Advanced document understanding technology automatically recognizes document structure and field relationships, creating extraction models that understand the context and layout of specific document types. Integration capabilities provide the same seamless API access for custom models as Mindee's pre-built solutions, with consistent response formats and implementation methods. By implementing docTI Custom Document Processing, organizations can extend automated extraction to all document types in their workflow rather than just standard formats, maintain consistent processing approaches across diverse document portfolios, accelerate time-to-value through rapid custom API creation without lengthy training periods, and reduce dependency on technical specialists for developing document automation solutions.

## Use Cases

### Expense Management Automation

Finance departments and expense management platforms implement Mindee's technology to transform how they process employee expenses and receipts. The system automatically extracts key information from receipts uploaded through mobile applications or web interfaces, capturing merchant details, transaction amounts, dates, and expense categories without requiring manual data entry from employees. Integration with expense management systems enables automatic population of expense reports with extracted data, dramatically reducing the time employees spend on expense submission. Policy compliance checking compares extracted receipt information against company spending policies, automatically flagging potential violations or unusual patterns for review. Mobile optimization ensures high extraction accuracy even from receipts photographed in suboptimal conditions like poor lighting or skewed angles. This implementation significantly improves employee productivity by reducing time spent on expense administration, accelerates reimbursement cycles through faster expense processing, enhances policy compliance through consistent receipt verification, and provides better expense analytics through structured, accurate receipt data. Companies like Indy have successfully integrated Mindee's receipt management solution to streamline their expense processes, demonstrating tangible efficiency improvements [[9]](https://www.mindee.com/case-study/receipt-management-indy).

### Accounts Payable Automation

Accounting departments leverage Mindee's invoice OCR API to streamline the processing of supplier invoices and accounts payable workflows. The platform automatically processes diverse invoice formats from different vendors, extracting critical information including header data, line items, tax information, and payment details without requiring template configuration for each supplier. Validation capabilities compare extracted data against purchase orders and vendor master data, flagging discrepancies for review. Integration with accounting systems and ERP platforms enables automated posting of verified invoices to the appropriate accounts. Exception handling routes unclear or problematic invoices to appropriate staff with the extracted data and original document presented side-by-side for efficient review. This approach significantly reduces invoice processing costs through automation of routine data entry, accelerates processing cycles to capture more early payment discounts, improves vendor relationships through faster, more accurate payments, and provides better visibility into payables and cash flow through timely, accurate invoice data [[10]](https://mindee.com/lp/process-invoices-with-ai-power).

### Financial Document Processing

Financial institutions implement Mindee's document understanding APIs to transform how they handle diverse financial documents including loan applications, statements, and compliance paperwork. The system automatically classifies and extracts key information from multiple document types, reducing manual data entry requirements and accelerating processing times. Custom extraction models handle organization-specific document formats that aren't covered by standard APIs, ensuring comprehensive automation across all document types. Integration with core banking systems and financial platforms enables straight-through processing for standard documents while routing exceptions for human review. Security features ensure document handling complies with financial regulations including data privacy requirements. This implementation dramatically accelerates document processing times from days to minutes, improves data accuracy through consistent AI-powered extraction compared to manual processing, enhances customer experience through faster application processing and onboarding, reduces operational costs by minimizing manual handling, and strengthens compliance through consistent document classification and data capture.
