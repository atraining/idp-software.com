### Accounts Payable Automation

Organizations implement Xtracta to streamline their accounts payable processes. The platform automatically extracts key information from supplier invoices, including header data (invoice numbers, dates, amounts) and line-item details. This extracted data is then validated and transferred to accounting or ERP systems, eliminating manual data entry and reducing processing time. The solution handles diverse invoice formats from different suppliers without requiring template configuration, and continuously improves its accuracy through machine learning as it processes more documents.

### Receipt Processing

Businesses use Xtracta to automate the processing of expense receipts. The system captures receipt images through mobile apps or other channels, extracts relevant information such as merchant details, transaction amounts, dates, and tax information, and organizes this data for expense management. This automation simplifies expense reporting for employees while providing finance departments with accurate, structured data for accounting and compliance purposes. The technology works across various receipt formats and languages, making it effective for organizations with global operations.
