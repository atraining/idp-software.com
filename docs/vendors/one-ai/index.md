# One AI

One AI is an API-first natural language processing platform providing pre-trained NLP models for text analysis, processing, and transformation tasks.

## Overview

One AI provides an NLP-as-a-Service platform for developers to analyze, process, and transform text through API integration. Founded in 2021, the company emerged from stealth with $8 million in seed funding in May 2022. The platform automatically matches pre-trained NLP models to customer tasks and domains including conversation summarization, sales insights, topic detection, and proofreading. One AI serves businesses automating text analysis workflows across multiple languages.

## Key Features

- **API-First Platform**: REST API for embedding NLP capabilities into applications
- **Pre-Trained Models**: Business-tailored NLP models automatically matched to tasks and domains
- **Text Analytics**: Conversation summarization, topic detection, sentiment analysis
- **Sales Insights**: Automated analysis of sales conversations and documents
- **Proofreading**: Text correction and quality improvement
- **Multi-Language Support**: Processing across multiple languages
- **Developer-Focused**: Built for integration into existing projects and workflows

## Use Cases

### Conversation Summarization
Organizations use One AI to automatically summarize customer service conversations, meeting transcripts, and call recordings. The API processes text and generates summaries tailored to business contexts without training custom models.

### Sales Intelligence
Sales teams integrate One AI for analyzing prospect conversations and emails. The platform extracts insights including sentiment, key topics, and action items from sales communications to improve follow-up and pipeline management.

### Content Processing
Companies automate document analysis by sending text through One AI's API for topic detection and [classification](../../capabilities/classification/index.md). The system identifies themes and categories across large document collections for knowledge management and content organization.
