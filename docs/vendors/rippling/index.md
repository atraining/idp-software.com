## Use Cases

### Streamlining Employee Onboarding and Offboarding

Organizations implement Rippling to automate the complex processes of bringing new employees on board and transitioning departing staff. When a new hire is added to the system, Rippling automatically generates and sends required paperwork, enrolls the employee in selected benefits plans, orders necessary equipment, creates accounts in relevant software systems, and assigns appropriate access permissions. For departing employees, the platform automatically initiates offboarding workflows that disable access to company systems, reclaim company equipment, process final payments, and handle benefits transitions. IT teams benefit from automated provisioning and deprovisioning of technology resources, eliminating manual setup and security risks. HR departments save significant time through reduced paperwork and manual processes. Finance teams gain accurate tracking of equipment assets and employee-related expenses. The implementation results in faster employee time-to-productivity, reduced security risks during transitions, consistent compliance with HR regulations, and significant time savings across departments.

### Managing Global Workforce Operations

Multinational companies leverage Rippling to centralize management of employees and contractors across multiple countries. The platform handles country-specific payroll calculations, tax filings, and compliance requirements through a single interface, eliminating the need for separate systems in each location. HR teams can manage benefits administration for international employees, with support for country-specific plans and requirements. Finance departments process expense reimbursements in local currencies, with automated currency conversion and accounting. IT teams deploy and manage equipment and software access for employees regardless of location, with appropriate security policies. This approach simplifies global workforce management through unified employee records across countries, ensures compliance with local labor and tax regulations, improves financial accuracy with automated currency handling, and provides better visibility into global workforce costs and performance.

### Unifying HR and IT Operations

Organizations implement Rippling to bridge the traditional gap between HR and IT departments. When an employee joins, changes roles, or leaves the company, the system automatically triggers appropriate IT actions based on HR changes. New hires receive precisely the right system access and equipment based on their role, department, and location without requiring separate IT tickets or processes. Role changes automatically adjust system permissions and equipment assignments to match new responsibilities. Departures trigger immediate deactivation of access across all connected systems, enhancing security. IT administrators gain visibility into upcoming workforce changes that impact technology needs, enabling better planning. This implementation reduces security risks through automated access management, improves efficiency by eliminating duplicate processes between departments, enhances the employee experience through seamless technology transitions, and provides better compliance with access control requirements and policies.
