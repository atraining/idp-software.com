# Rippling News Review

## Executive Summary

While no direct company-specific developments were reported for Rippling during this period, the HR and payroll software company gained significant market recognition as industry analysts positioned it among the top candidates for a potential public offering following Figma's successful $1.22 billion IPO. Matt Kennedy, Senior Strategist at Renaissance Capital, specifically identified Rippling alongside Canva, Databricks, and Avalara as prime IPO candidates who could benefit from the renewed investor confidence in venture-backed technology companies, suggesting the company has reached sufficient scale and market maturity for public market consideration ([Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/figmas-stunning-market-debut-wows-investors-it-is-the-largest-vc-backed-us-tech-company-ipo-in-years/articleshow/123024075.cms)).

## Market Context

The successful reception of Figma's market debut, which achieved a $19.3 billion valuation, has created a more favorable investment climate for private software companies considering public offerings.
