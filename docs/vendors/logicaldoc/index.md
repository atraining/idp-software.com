## Use Cases

### Corporate Document Management

Organizations implement LogicalDOC to create a structured repository for business documents including contracts, policies, procedures, and corporate records. The platform organizes documents using customizable folder structures and metadata schemas that reflect departmental and functional categorizations. Version control maintains complete document history with the ability to compare or restore previous versions. Access controls restrict document visibility based on roles, groups, and security settings appropriate to organizational hierarchies. Workflow capabilities automate document review and approval processes with notification systems that alert users to pending tasks. Full-text search enables users to quickly locate documents based on content, metadata, or both. This implementation centralizes organizational knowledge in a searchable repository, ensures document consistency through controlled versioning, improves compliance through access controls and audit trails, and enhances productivity through faster document retrieval.

### Contract Lifecycle Management

Organizations utilize LogicalDOC to manage their complete contract lifecycle from creation through expiration. The platform stores contract documents with metadata capturing key information such as parties involved, effective dates, renewal dates, and contract value. Document templates provide standardized starting points for new contracts, while versioning tracks changes throughout negotiation processes. Workflow automation routes contracts through customized approval paths based on contract type, value, or other parameters. Calendar integration provides notifications of upcoming contract milestones including renewals and expirations. Search capabilities allow quick identification of contracts containing specific clauses or terms. This approach reduces contract management overhead through automation, minimizes risk through improved visibility of contract obligations, ensures compliance through consistent processes, and provides better business intelligence through centralized contract information.
