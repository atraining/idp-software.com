## Summary

This article discusses the release of a biodiversity primer for landscape architects by ASLA, with input from Aida Curtis who chairs the Climate & Biodiversity Action Committee. However, this content is entirely unrelated to the IDP (Intelligent Document Processing) industry and appears to reference a different person named Aida Curtis who works in landscape architecture rather than the IDP vendor 'aida'. The article contains no information relevant to document processing, OCR technology, AI/ML capabilities, or any other aspects of the IDP market.

## Executive Insights

**Aida Curtis, FASLA, PLA, Chair, ASLA Climate & Biodiversity Action Committee and president, Curtis + Rogers Design Studio**

> "The loss of biodiversity worldwide continues to accelerate. We need to rapidly shift to better ways of designing and managing landscapes and do our part to achieve global 2030 goals. The primer introduces the real, concrete steps we can take on every project to protect, conserve, enhance, or restore healthy, enduring habitats for more species."

*Context: Discussing the release of the Biodiversity Primer for Landscape Architects*

*Significance: This quote is from Aida Curtis, but relates to landscape architecture and biodiversity, not IDP technology*
