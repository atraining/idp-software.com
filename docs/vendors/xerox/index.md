## Use Cases

### Enterprise Document Management

Organizations implement Xerox solutions to create comprehensive document management ecosystems. The approach begins with high-volume document capture using Xerox scanning hardware and software, followed by intelligent processing that automatically classifies documents, extracts key data, and routes information to appropriate workflows. Content management systems organize the digitized documents while maintaining security and compliance controls. Workflow automation handles approvals and exceptions while integration with business systems ensures data consistency across the enterprise. This end-to-end approach reduces document handling costs, improves information accessibility, strengthens compliance capabilities, and accelerates document-dependent processes.

### Accounts Payable Automation

Finance departments utilize Xerox's intelligent document processing to streamline accounts payable operations. The solution captures incoming invoices through multiple channels, automatically extracts header and line-item details, validates the information against purchase orders and receiving documents, and routes for appropriate approvals. Integration with ERP and accounting systems enables straight-through processing for matched invoices while exception handling workflows manage discrepancies efficiently. The implementation provides visibility into invoice status, captures early payment discounts, reduces processing costs significantly, and improves supplier relationships through more consistent payment processes.
