## Use Cases

### Personal Injury Case Management

Law firms implement SmartAdvocate to streamline the handling of personal injury cases from intake to resolution. The system captures initial client information through customizable intake forms, automatically generating engagement letters and HIPAA authorizations based on case details. As the case progresses, the platform organizes medical records, bills, and reports with automated categorization and tracking of treatment timelines. Document automation tools generate demand letters, pleadings, and discovery requests using case-specific data, while deadline tracking ensures timely filing of all documents. Settlement negotiations are managed through dedicated modules that track offers, counteroffers, and itemized breakdowns of recoverable damages. This comprehensive approach reduces case handling time by up to 30%, improves consistency in case preparation, enhances client communication through automated status updates, and increases settlement values through more thorough documentation of damages.

### Mass Tort Litigation Management

Litigation teams utilize SmartAdvocate to efficiently manage large volumes of plaintiffs in mass tort proceedings. The solution provides specialized intake workflows for mass tort recruitment, capturing client-specific information while identifying common elements across the plaintiff pool. Document processing tools automatically categorize and extract relevant information from medical records, prescriptions, and other evidence to support case qualification and valuation. The system tracks individual plaintiff details while maintaining centralized access to common discovery materials, expert reports, and research. Built-in analytics identify trends across plaintiff groups to inform litigation strategy. Multi-tier access controls enable collaboration between lead counsel, local attorneys, and staff while maintaining appropriate information boundaries. This implementation accelerates case evaluation and filing processes, improves coordination among legal teams, enhances reporting capabilities for lead counsel, and strengthens overall case management in complex multi-plaintiff litigation.
