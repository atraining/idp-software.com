## News Review for icertis

# Icertis News Review

## Executive Summary

Icertis faced mixed market developments during this period, with the contract management software company losing its position on the prestigious Forbes Cloud 100 list after ranking 39th in 2024, while simultaneously receiving recognition in a market research report positioning it among ten key players in the electronic contract management sector through 2030 alongside established vendors like SAP, Oracle, and DocuSign. The company's removal from the Forbes ranking represents a notable setback in market perception as legal tech companies gained prominence in cloud software recognition, while the market research inclusion validates Icertis's continued relevance in the evolving contract management landscape that increasingly emphasizes AI-driven analytics and cloud-native platforms.

## Key Developments

**Market Recognition Changes**: Icertis dropped off the Forbes Cloud 100 list after achieving a 39th position ranking in 2024, losing recognition among top cloud computing companies ([source](https://www.lawnext.com/2025/09/four-legal-tech-companies-make-the-forbes-cloud-100-and-two-others-are-rising-stars.html)). Simultaneously, the company was featured among ten key players in a market research report forecasting the electronic contract management market through 2030 ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/09/26/3157106/28124/en/Electronic-Contract-Management-Global-Market-Forecast-Report-2025-2030-Featuring-Icertis-SAP-Oracle-Coupa-Software-Conga-DocuSign-Agiloft-Ironclad-SirionLabs-and-Evisort.html)).

**Competitive Positioning**: The market research report positioned Icertis alongside established enterprise software vendors including SAP, Oracle, Coupa Software, Conga, DocuSign, Agiloft, Ironclad, SirionLabs, and Evisort in the contract management space.

## Market Context

The developments reflect broader market dynamics in the contract management sector, where cloud-native platforms with AI-driven analytics are reducing manual tasks and integration requirements with ERP and CRM platforms for automated workflows are becoming critical competitive factors. While Icertis lost ground in general cloud software recognition, the company maintains visibility in its core contract management market as the sector evolves toward AI-enabled solutions and seamless system integration capabilities across legal, procurement, and finance systems.

## Strategic Implications

The loss of Forbes Cloud 100 recognition may impact Icertis's market perception and competitive positioning in the broader cloud software space, potentially requiring the company to reassess its growth strategy and metrics to regain standing among leading cloud companies. However, continued inclusion in contract management market research alongside major enterprise software vendors suggests the company retains credibility in its core market segment. The competitive landscape shows legal tech companies gaining prominence while Icertis faces pressure to demonstrate growth metrics that align with top-tier cloud software recognition criteria.
