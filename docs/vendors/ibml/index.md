## Use Cases

### Banking Remittance Processing

Financial institutions outsource check and payment processing to ibml's BPO division, which operates high-speed scanners capturing check images, remittance slips, and payment coupons. Intelligent capture technology extracts account numbers, payment amounts, and customer identifiers, validating data against account databases. Exception items with poor image quality or handwriting route to human reviewers. Processed payment data transmits to core banking systems for posting to customer accounts.

### Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management

Hospital systems and medical practices partner with ibml to automate patient registration, insurance verification, and claims processing workflows. Document scanners digitize patient intake forms, insurance cards, referrals, and medical records upon arrival. Intelligent capture extracts patient demographics, insurance policy numbers, and diagnosis codes, populating electronic health record fields. Claims data exports to billing systems for submission to payers while maintaining HIPAA compliance.

### Mailroom Automation

Corporate and government mailrooms deploy ibml production mail equipment to sort, open, scan, and distribute incoming correspondence. High-speed letter openers process thousands of envelopes hourly, extracting contents for scanning. Document classification algorithms identify mail types (invoices, applications, inquiries), route digital images to appropriate departments, and trigger workflow processes. Physical mail archives in climate-controlled storage while digital copies enable instant access.
