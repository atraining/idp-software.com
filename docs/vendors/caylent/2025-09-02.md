## News Review for caylent

# Caylent News Review

## Executive Summary

Caylent has positioned itself as a thought leader in the database modernization space through the release of comprehensive survey findings revealing critical market inefficiencies, with only 6% of challenging database migrations completing on time according to their study of over 300 IT leaders across finance, healthcare, and manufacturing sectors ([VMblog](https://vmblog.com:443/archive/2025/08/19/only-6-of-challenging-database-migrations-completed-on-time-caylent-survey-reveals.aspx)). The survey strategically highlights a significant market opportunity for Caylent's AI-driven solutions, particularly as 60% of organizations are adopting GenAI and automation tools for migrations but 53% lack clarity on optimal AI tool selection, creating a competitive advantage for Caylent's integrated approach that combines generative AI with deep engineering expertise to address persistent challenges of tech debt and outdated migration approaches.

## Key Developments

**Market Research and Thought Leadership**: Caylent released results from their 2025 Database Migration survey, establishing the company as an authoritative voice in database modernization challenges. The comprehensive study of 300+ IT leaders revealed that only 6% of organizations completed their most challenging database migrations on time, with an equal percentage achieving zero downtime ([VMblog](https://vmblog.com:443/archive/2025/08/19/only-6-of-challenging-database-migrations-completed-on-time-caylent-survey-reveals.aspx)).

**Strategic Market Positioning**: The survey findings strategically position Caylent to capitalize on widespread market confusion about AI tool selection, with 53% of organizations lacking clarity on which AI tools to use despite 60% adopting GenAI or automation tools for database migrations.

## Market Context

The database modernization market faces significant execution challenges despite growing AI adoption, creating substantial opportunities for specialized service providers. Caylent's survey reveals a critical gap between AI tool availability and practical implementation expertise, with 94% of challenging migrations failing to complete on time. This market inefficiency positions companies like Caylent that offer integrated AI solutions with engineering expertise to capture market share by addressing the disconnect between technology adoption and successful implementation outcomes.

## Notable Quotes

**Lori Williams, CEO of Caylent**: "The survey confirms what we see every day - modernization is imperative, but too often organizations are slowed by accumulated tech debt and outdated approaches that create unnecessary downtime and delayed returns. At Caylent, we combine generative AI with deep engineering expertise to lower the barrier of entry for even the most complex projects and accelerate the time to savings. That means faster migrations, reduced legacy costs, and a stronger foundation for growth in a market defined by constant change."

The findings create a compelling business case for Caylent's differentiated approach of combining generative AI with engineering expertise, positioning the company to capture market share from organizations struggling with the 94% failure rate in on-time migration completion.
