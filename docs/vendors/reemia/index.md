## Use Cases

### Document Digitization

Organizations implement Reemia's Orion solution to transform paper and digital archives into structured, searchable data repositories. The system processes large volumes of historical documents including contracts, forms, reports, and correspondence that previously required manual review. AI-powered OCR and data extraction technologies automatically identify and capture key information from documents regardless of format or structure. Classification algorithms categorize documents based on content, making them easily retrievable through search functions. Integration with existing databases ensures that extracted information enriches the organization's knowledge base. This implementation reduces physical storage needs through digital transformation, improves document accessibility through powerful search capabilities, enhances data quality through consistent extraction methodology, and unlocks valuable insights previously hidden in unstructured documents.

### Automated Invoice Processing

Finance departments leverage Reemia's document processing capabilities to streamline accounts payable operations. The system automatically captures incoming invoices from various sources including email attachments, scanned paper documents, and electronic formats. Intelligent extraction identifies and captures critical invoice data including vendor information, invoice numbers, line items, amounts, and payment terms. Validation workflows flag potential discrepancies or missing information for quick human verification. Integration with accounting systems enables automated data transfer to financial platforms. This approach reduces manual data entry through automated extraction, accelerates processing cycles from days to minutes, improves accuracy by eliminating human errors, and provides better visibility into financial operations through structured data collection.
