## News Review for quadient

# Quadient Comprehensive News Review

## Executive Summary

Quadient achieved a significant strategic milestone in the French e-invoicing market as its recently acquired Serensia platform successfully passed interoperability testing with French tax authorities, positioning the company as one of only three certified platforms selected for the initial round of real-world testing under France's mandatory e-invoicing reform. This certification validates Quadient's acquisition strategy and establishes a competitive advantage in a market that will encompass all French companies, from large enterprises to SMEs and accounting firms, with the Peppol-connected platform now able to register clients ahead of final registration expected in fall 2025. Additionally, the company issued routine regulatory disclosures showing 34,468,912 total outstanding shares and 33,709,151 net voting rights as of July 31, 2025, providing standard transparency into its ownership structure.

## Market Context

Quadient's certification success positions the company advantageously within France's phased mandatory e-invoicing rollout, which requires government certification for solution providers. The limited number of certified platforms creates a competitive moat and first-mover advantage in a market that will eventually encompass all French businesses. This development aligns with broader European digitalization initiatives and regulatory compliance requirements, particularly as France implements one of the most comprehensive mandatory e-invoicing systems in Europe.

## Notable Quotes

Geoffrey Godet, CEO of Quadient, stated: "The French Public Finance Department's selection of Serensia for the initial round of real-world testing speaks to the strength of the solution. Its successful compliance testing validates the strategic choices we've made, particularly the acquisition of Serensia, which now positions Quadient at the forefront of the reform's implementation across all French companies."

## Strategic Implications

The successful certification of Serensia validates Quadient's acquisition strategy and establishes the company as a market leader in French e-invoicing compliance. This positioning provides significant competitive advantages, including early market entry, government validation, and the ability to capture market share across the full spectrum of French businesses. The certification creates barriers to entry for competitors and positions Quadient to benefit from the mandatory nature of France's e-invoicing reform, potentially generating substantial recurring revenue as businesses transition to digital invoicing systems.
