## Use Cases

### Intelligent Document Processing

Organizations implement SER Group's Doxis platform to transform how they handle business documents. The system captures incoming documents from multiple channels (email, scan, electronic formats) and automatically classifies them by type, extracting relevant data through AI-enhanced recognition technology. Content is validated against business rules and existing systems, triggering appropriate workflows based on document type and content. Integration with line-of-business applications enables straight-through processing while maintaining a comprehensive audit trail for compliance purposes. This approach reduces manual document handling by up to 80%, improves information accessibility through centralized storage and powerful search capabilities, accelerates processing times from days to minutes, and enhances compliance through consistent application of information governance policies.

### Contract Lifecycle Management

Legal and procurement departments utilize Doxis to streamline the entire contract management process. The solution manages contract creation through templates and clause libraries, facilitates collaborative review and approval workflows, and maintains a secure repository of all executed agreements. AI-enhanced analytics extract key provisions, obligations, and expiration dates, triggering automatic notifications for renewal deadlines and compliance requirements. The platform maintains relationships between master agreements, amendments, and related documents while providing powerful search capabilities across the contract portfolio. This implementation reduces contract processing time by up to 50%, improves compliance through automated monitoring of obligations, enhances visibility into contractual relationships and commitments, and provides a complete audit trail of all contract-related activities from initiation through fulfillment or termination.
