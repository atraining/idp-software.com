## Overview

Founded in Durham, North Carolina, Infinia ML developed machine learning-powered intelligent document processing for healthcare, life sciences, financial services, legal, and compliance sectors. The company's platform used ML algorithms to extract data from complex documents, enabling enterprises to identify trends, improve processes, and make data-driven decisions. In September 2023, Aspirion, a Columbus, Georgia-based healthcare revenue cycle management provider, acquired Infinia ML for undisclosed terms. Infinia ML now operates as Aspirion's research and development engine, focusing on improving financial performance for healthcare providers through AI-powered document processing. The acquisition marked Aspirion's eighth successful transaction in five years and first technology asset acquisition. Prior to acquisition, Aspirion and Infinia ML partnered on projects demonstrating positive impacts for healthcare clients.

## Use Cases

### Healthcare Revenue Cycle Automation

Hospitals and health systems use Infinia ML's technology (now through Aspirion) to automate claims denial management, payment posting, and account resolution. The platform extracts data from explanation of benefits (EOB) documents, remittance advice, denial letters, and payer correspondence. Automated extraction identifies denial reasons, payment variances, and required documentation, routing cases to revenue cycle specialists with relevant context for faster resolution.

### Medical Records Processing

Healthcare providers process patient records, referrals, prior authorizations, and clinical documentation through ML-based extraction. The system captures diagnosis codes, procedure details, medication lists, and clinical notes from varied document formats arriving via fax, email, and portal uploads. Structured data flows to electronic health record systems, reducing manual abstraction time for health information management departments.

### Claims Documentation Review

Payers and third-party administrators analyze claims attachments including medical records, operative reports, and diagnostic imaging reports. Infinia ML's algorithms extract clinical evidence supporting medical necessity, identify procedure codes matching documentation, and flag discrepancies for claims examiners. Automated review accelerates claims adjudication while maintaining accuracy for complex medical claims requiring clinical documentation support.
