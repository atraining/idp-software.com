## Overview

Founded in 2001 by Alastair Bathgate and David Moss, Blue Prism launched its first commercial product, Automate, in 2003 and coined the term "robotic process automation (RPA)" in 2012. Acquired by SS&C Technologies in March 2022 for $1.6 billion after a competitive bidding process, the company operates as SS&C Blue Prism, serving financial services and healthcare sectors. Headquartered in Windsor, Connecticut, SS&C Blue Prism combines RPA, BPM, low-code/no-code capabilities, and intelligent automation into a unified platform.

## Use Cases

### Financial Services Invoice Processing

Banks and financial institutions deploy Decipher IDP to process invoices and purchase orders at scale. The system uses OCR and machine learning to [classify](../../capabilities/classification/index.md) document types, [extract](../../capabilities/extraction/index.md) line items and payment details, and validate data through multiple validation layers. Native integration with Blue Prism RPA enables automated data entry into accounting systems with customizable validation rules.

### Healthcare Claims Documentation

Healthcare providers use Blue Prism Document Automation to process insurance claims with handwritten forms and low-quality scanned documents. The platform digitizes patient information, extracts diagnosis codes and treatment details, validates data against healthcare databases, and routes exceptions for human review, reducing manual claims processing time.

### Banking Customer Onboarding

Financial institutions implement Blue Prism to automate KYC and customer onboarding processes. Decipher IDP extracts data from passports, driver's licenses, and identity documents, validates information across multiple data sources, and triggers RPA workflows for account creation, processing documents in hours rather than days.
