# Blue Prism News Review

## Executive Summary

SS&C Blue Prism is positioning itself as a thought leader in the evolving enterprise automation landscape through strategic market research and industry participation, with the company's survey revealing that 79% of Fortune 500 companies have active agentic AI projects and 30% are already implementing solutions, demonstrating significant enterprise momentum in autonomous AI adoption ([source](https://www.jeffbullas.com/agentic-ai-metaverse/)). The company maintains its recognition as an enterprise-grade RPA provider with strong scalability and compliance controls in competitive analyses ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2025/07/08/uipath-cto-details-office-layout-for-agents-robots-and-humans/)), while actively engaging with European enterprise decision-makers through its participation as an exhibitor at Digital Transformation Expo Europe 2025 in Amsterdam this September ([source](https://vmblog.com:443/archive/2025/07/17/digital-transformation-europe-returns-to-amsterdam-the-premier-enterprise-tech-event-of-the-year.aspx)). These developments collectively position Blue Prism at the intersection of traditional RPA excellence and emerging agentic AI adoption, though the company faces intensified competition in the rapidly evolving automation market projected to reach $187 billion by 2034.

## Key Developments

**Market Research Leadership**: Blue Prism conducted significant research on agentic AI adoption, revealing that 79% of Fortune 500 companies have active agentic AI projects, with 44% planning integration within the next year. This research positions the company as a thought leader in enterprise AI adoption trends.

**Industry Event Participation**: SS&C Blue Prism will showcase its robotic process automation solutions at Digital Transformation Expo Europe in Amsterdam on September 24-25, 2025, joining over 200 technology exhibitors targeting 8,000+ senior enterprise technology professionals.

**Competitive Recognition**: Blue Prism was identified as a key player in enterprise-grade RPA with strong scalability and compliance controls in competitive analyses examining the evolution toward agentic orchestration platforms.

## Market Context

Blue Prism's developments occur within a rapidly expanding agentic AI market that received $91.5 billion in VC investment in Q1 2025 globally, with projections showing growth from $5-7 billion currently to $187 billion by 2034. However, the market faces potential volatility, with Gartner warning that 40% of agentic AI projects may be scrapped by 2027 due to cost concerns and unclear value propositions. This dynamic creates both opportunities for established automation vendors like Blue Prism and intensified competition from AI-enhanced platforms, pure-play AI startups, and major competitors including UiPath, Automation Anywhere, and Microsoft in the converging RPA-AI agent space.

## Strategic Implications

Blue Prism's strategic positioning reflects a company leveraging its enterprise RPA heritage to compete in the emerging agentic orchestration market. The company's research-driven thought leadership approach, combined with its established Fortune 500 presence, provides credibility as enterprises navigate AI automation decisions amid market hype. However, Blue Prism must evolve beyond traditional RPA capabilities to maintain competitiveness in the AI-enhanced workflow orchestration battleground, where the ability to manage AI agents alongside traditional automation robots becomes increasingly critical. The company's focus on enterprise-grade compliance and scalability may prove advantageous as the market matures and organizations prioritize proven solutions over experimental AI implementations.
