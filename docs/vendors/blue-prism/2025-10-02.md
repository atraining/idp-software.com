## News Review for blue-prism

# Blue Prism News Review

## Executive Summary

Blue Prism maintained its position among leading Digital Process Automation vendors in a market projected to reach $36.01 billion by 2032, according to SNS Insider research, while the company's stock experienced modest gains of 2% to $16.65 amid exceptionally low trading volumes that declined 92% to just 300 shares. The company continues to serve multiple industries including financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and public sector across global markets in EMEA, The Americas, and APAC regions, though operates within a challenging enterprise AI landscape where MIT research indicates 95% of AI agent projects fail to reach production deployment.

## Key Developments

**Market Recognition**: Blue Prism was listed among 20 leading vendors in SNS Insider's Digital Process Automation market report alongside major competitors including IBM, UiPath, Automation Anywhere, and Microsoft in a market growing at 12.55% CAGR ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/09/18/3152193/0/en/Digital-Process-Automation-Market-Size-to-Hit-USD-36-01-Billion-by-2032-at-12-55-CAGR-Research-by-SNS-Insider.html)).

**Stock Performance**: Blue Prism Group shares increased 2% to $16.65 during Thursday trading, though trading volume dropped dramatically to 300 shares from an average of 3,774 shares per session, representing a 92% decline in investor activity ([source](https://www.etfdailynews.com/2025/09/12/blue-prism-group-otcmktsbprmf-trading-2-higher-should-you-buy/)).

## Market Context

The Digital Process Automation market is experiencing robust growth, expanding from $14.04 billion in 2024 toward a projected $36.01 billion by 2032, driven by operational efficiency demands and cloud adoption. Cloud-based deployment models currently lead with 61.6% market share, creating competitive pressure for automation vendors to prioritize cloud-first capabilities. However, the broader enterprise AI landscape presents challenges, with MIT research showing 95% failure rates in AI agent projects and fewer than 10% of generative AI use cases progressing beyond pilot stage, potentially impacting intelligent automation vendors' growth strategies.

## Strategic Implications

Blue Prism's inclusion among leading DPA market vendors validates its competitive positioning but highlights the need to differentiate against larger players like IBM and Microsoft in an expanding automation market. The company's global presence across EMEA, The Americas, and APAC regions provides geographic diversification, while its multi-industry approach spanning financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and public sector offers market breadth. However, the exceptionally low trading volumes suggest limited current investor engagement, and the high failure rates in enterprise AI projects may require Blue Prism to demonstrate proven frameworks and successful deployment methodologies to capitalize on the growing market opportunity in cloud-based process automation.
