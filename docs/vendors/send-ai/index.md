## Overview

Send AI provides [document processing](../../capabilities/document-understanding/index.md) automation through self-learning AI models that customers train on their specific data. The platform extracts information from complex documents including low-quality scans, photographed paperwork, and lengthy PDFs. Send AI uses a combination of smaller open-source models rather than large commercial models like ChatGPT. The company operates on Google Cloud Platform infrastructure with ISO27001:2022 certification and GDPR compliance. Founded in Amsterdam in 2021 as Autopilot by Thom Trentelman and Philip Weijschede, the company raised €2.2M in pre-seed funding from Google's AI fund.

## Key Features

- **Self-Learning AI Models**: Custom model training on organization-specific data with isolated processing
- **Document Pre-Processing**: Automated document preparation and segmentation for complex files
- **Human-in-the-Loop Validation**: Manual verification workflows for [extraction](../../capabilities/extraction/index.md) accuracy
- **Custom Rule Engine**: Configurable validation rules for data quality assurance
- **Modular Processing**: Breaks complex documents into manageable segments
- **Data Ownership**: Full customer control of data and trained models
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Cloud-based processing on Google Cloud Platform

## Use Cases

### Logistics Document Processing

Logistics companies deploy Send AI to process shipping documents, bills of lading, and customs paperwork. The platform extracts data from photographed documents and low-quality scans common in supply chain operations, with custom models trained on company-specific document formats.

### Insurance Claims Automation

Insurance providers use the platform to automate claims processing from diverse document sources. The system handles lengthy PDF documents, extracts policy information, and applies custom validation rules specific to insurance workflows while maintaining GDPR compliance for sensitive customer data.

### Government Document Management

Government agencies process citizen submissions, forms, and administrative documents through Send AI workflows. The platform segments complex multi-page documents, validates extracted information against defined rules, and routes processed data through approval workflows with human-in-the-loop verification.
