## Use Cases

### Banking Document Processing

Financial institutions implement Serimag's solutions to automate the processing of loan applications and supporting documentation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Serimag helped Spanish banks process more than 5 million documents (20 million pages) related to loan requests from companies seeking financial aid from Instituto de Cr√©dito Oficial (ICO) [[3]](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/36491/customerstory-intelligent-document-processing-financial-services-serimag-en.pdf). The system captures incoming loan documents through multiple channels, including scanned paper, email attachments, and digital uploads. AI-powered classification automatically categorizes documents by type (ID verification, financial statements, tax records, etc.). Intelligent OCR extracts relevant data fields with high accuracy, even from complex or low-quality documents. Validation rules verify extracted information against business requirements. The processed data is then integrated with the bank's loan management systems. This implementation accelerates loan processing through automated document handling, improves data accuracy through consistent extraction methodology, enhances compliance through comprehensive validation, and increases customer satisfaction through faster application processing.

### Insurance Claims Automation

Insurance companies leverage Serimag's technology to streamline their claims processing workflows. The solution automates the intake of claims forms and supporting documentation, including accident reports, medical records, and repair estimates. Document classification identifies and separates different document types within a claim file. Data extraction capabilities capture relevant claim details, policy information, and incident data. NLP technology understands the context of information within documents to extract meaningful insights. Workflow automation routes claims to appropriate handlers based on claim type, complexity, and priority. The system maintains an audit trail of all processing steps for compliance purposes. This approach reduces claims processing time through automated information extraction, improves accuracy through consistent data capture, enhances adjuster productivity by eliminating manual document review, and provides better visibility into claims status and processing metrics.

### Back-Office Document Management

Organizations implement Serimag's solutions to transform their back-office document management operations. The system centralizes document processing across departments, including finance, human resources, and operations. Intelligent document capture converts physical documents to digital formats while extracting key metadata. Classification capabilities automatically organize documents by type, department, and purpose. Data extraction tools identify and capture critical information from invoices, contracts, and other business documents. Workflow automation routes documents to appropriate stakeholders for review and approval. Integration with enterprise systems ensures that extracted data flows into relevant business applications. This implementation reduces manual handling through automated document routing, improves information accessibility through digital transformation, enhances data quality through consistent extraction methodology, and accelerates business processes through streamlined document workflows.
