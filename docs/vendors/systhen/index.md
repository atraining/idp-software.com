## Use Cases

### Enterprise Document Management

Organizations implement Systhen's ECM platform to establish a centralized repository for all business documents. The system captures documents from multiple sources including scanners, email, and application outputs, applying consistent metadata and classification. Role-based security ensures appropriate access controls while maintaining document accessibility. Advanced search features enable users to quickly locate documents using full-text search, metadata filters, and saved queries. Version control maintains document history and provides audit trails of all document activities. Integration with business applications allows documents to be accessed in the context of business processes. This implementation reduces information silos by consolidating document storage, improves efficiency through faster document retrieval, enhances security through consistent access controls, and supports compliance through comprehensive audit trails and retention management.

### Automated Approval Workflows

Departments leverage Systhen's workflow capabilities to streamline document-centric approval processes. The solution supports the creation of structured workflows with sequential and parallel approval paths based on document types and business rules. Automatic notifications alert approvers when documents require their attention, with escalation procedures for overdue items. Digital signature integration enables secure electronic signing of approved documents. Mobile accessibility allows approvers to review and authorize documents from any location. Real-time dashboards provide visibility into workflow status and identify bottlenecks. This approach accelerates approval cycles through automated routing, improves accountability through clear task assignment and tracking, reduces errors through consistent process execution, and enhances visibility through real-time process monitoring.

### Regulatory Compliance and Records Management

Regulated industries implement Systhen's records management capabilities to maintain compliance with industry regulations and internal policies. The system applies retention schedules to documents based on their classification, automatically managing the document lifecycle from creation to disposition. Legal hold features prevent modification or deletion of documents subject to litigation or investigation. Detailed audit trails track all document access and activities to support compliance verification. Automated disposition workflows ensure proper review and approval before document destruction. Regular compliance reports demonstrate adherence to retention policies. This implementation strengthens regulatory compliance through systematic records management, reduces legal risk through defensible disposition practices, simplifies audit processes through comprehensive documentation, and optimizes storage costs through appropriate document retention and timely disposition.
