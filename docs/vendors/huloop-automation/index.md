## Use Cases

### Financial Services Loan Processing

Banks deploy HuLoop to automate mortgage and commercial loan applications combining document processing with workflow orchestration. The platform extracts applicant data, income verification, and credit reports through IDP, then triggers RPA bots retrieving information from credit bureaus and property valuation systems. Human underwriters review flagged applications through the human-in-the-loop interface, making approval decisions while automation handles compliant document gathering and system updates.

### E-Commerce Order Fulfillment

Commerce companies automate order-to-cash processes by integrating HuLoop with inventory, shipping, and accounting systems. Process mining identifies bottlenecks in order workflows, task mining documents manual steps performed by customer service teams, and RPA bots execute repetitive actions like order entry, shipment scheduling, and invoice generation. Exception handling routes orders with inventory shortages or address validation failures to human operators.

### Insurance Claims Intake

Insurance carriers process claims by combining IDP extraction of claim forms, police reports, and supporting documents with RPA workflows querying policy systems and fraud databases. The platform classifies claim types, routes to appropriate adjusters, and flags suspicious patterns for human review. Automated testing validates that RPA workflows correctly handle policy lookups and premium calculations before production deployment.
