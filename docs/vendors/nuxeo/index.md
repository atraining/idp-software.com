## Use Cases

### Digital Asset Management

Media and marketing organizations implement Nuxeo as their digital asset management solution to centralize and optimize creative content workflows. The platform ingests, organizes, and processes diverse media types including images, videos, 3D files, and compound assets like InDesign packages. Powerful metadata capabilities enable precise tagging using both manual and AI-assisted methods, while version control maintains the complete history of each asset. Workflow automation streamlines creative review cycles with customizable approval paths and annotation tools. Integration with creative tools (Adobe Creative Cloud, Figma) allows users to access and contribute assets without leaving their preferred applications. The platform's powerful rendering engine automatically generates appropriate derivatives for different channels and devices. This implementation accelerates time-to-market for campaigns, ensures brand consistency through controlled asset distribution, reduces production costs through asset reuse, and provides actionable insights on asset performance and usage.

### Enterprise Content Management at Scale

Large organizations utilize Nuxeo to manage high-volume, complex content repositories with strict compliance requirements. The platform's microservices architecture supports billions of documents with millisecond response times, while the Elasticsearch backend enables advanced search across massive content stores. Classification services automatically categorize incoming documents using machine learning models trained on organizational taxonomies. Records management capabilities enforce retention policies and legal holds based on content type and regulatory requirements. Integration with enterprise systems creates a unified information ecosystem while federation services connect to legacy repositories. Audit trails and permission models ensure regulatory compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and industry-specific regulations. This approach transforms information access through powerful search capabilities, reduces compliance risk through automated governance, improves decision-making through contextual information delivery, and future-proofs content infrastructure through a flexible, extensible architecture.
