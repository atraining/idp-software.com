## Summary

HCLTech is taking a distinctive approach to AI adoption by positioning artificial intelligence as a tool for job augmentation rather than replacement, directly contrasting with industry peers like TCS who recently announced 12,000 job cuts. Chairperson Roshni Nadar Malhotra emphasized at the company's AGM that AI serves as a 'co-pilot to augment human capabilities,' while the company invests in specialized AI roles for 15% of new hires and develops an 'elite cadre' of highly skilled staff earning 3-4 times typical entry-level salaries. This 'responsible AI adopter' positioning, combined with improved attrition rates dropping from 13% to 12.8%, represents a strategic bet that growth-oriented talent management will create competitive differentiation in the market, though it may challenge short-term cost competitiveness against rivals pursuing AI-driven workforce reductions.
