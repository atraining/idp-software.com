# RaccoonDoc

RaccoonDoc is a cloud-native IDPaaS platform from Kyiv, Ukraine achieving up to 98% data extraction accuracy with 25x faster processing than manual methods.

## Overview

RaccoonDoc emerged from Innora, a Kyiv-based UiPath Gold Partner and RPA system integrator, launching in 2021 as war broke out in Ukraine. The platform provides IDP as a Service (IDPaaS) using machine learning, computer vision, and neural networks for structured and unstructured data [extraction](../../capabilities/extraction/index.md) from complex documents. The 100% cloud-native solution combines automated ML-based extraction with in-house human-in-the-loop (HITL) review teams guaranteeing 100% accuracy on returned data. Customers upload documents to the RaccoonDoc cloud where the team fine-tunes ML models, performs extraction, and validates results before delivery.

## Key Features

- **IDPaaS (IDP as a Service)**: Fully cloud-native platform without on-premise infrastructure requirements
- **ML Model Fine-Tuning**: Custom model adaptation for customer-specific document types
- **Human-in-the-Loop Validation**: In-house HITL team reviews all extractions for 100% accuracy guarantee
- **Advanced ML Algorithms**: Computer vision and neural networks for complex document analysis
- **Structured and Unstructured Processing**: Handles diverse document formats and layouts
- **High Accuracy**: Up to 98% extraction accuracy reported
- **Speed Optimization**: 25x faster processing compared to manual data entry

## Use Cases

### Enterprise Document Processing with Accuracy Guarantee
Organizations use RaccoonDoc for high-stakes document processing where accuracy is critical. Customers upload invoices, contracts, or forms to the cloud platform where ML models extract data, then HITL teams validate every field before returning results with 100% accuracy guarantee for downstream systems.

### Complex Document Analysis
Companies with unstructured or variable-format documents implement RaccoonDoc for extraction tasks beyond standard templates. The platform fine-tunes neural networks to customer document types, applying computer vision to extract data from layouts that challenge traditional OCR systems.

### RPA Integration Projects
Enterprises working with Innora for RPA implementations extend workflows with RaccoonDoc for document processing steps. The UiPath partnership enables seamless integration where bots trigger document uploads, RaccoonDoc performs extraction with HITL validation, and results feed back into automated workflows.
