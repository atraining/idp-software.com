## Use Cases

### Property and Casualty Underwriting

P&C carriers deploy SortSpoke to automate submission intake and data extraction from ACORD forms and supporting documents. The platform triages incoming submissions by risk type, extracts policy information, and pre-fills underwriting systems while underwriters verify extracted data through review interfaces.

### Loss Run Processing

Insurance companies process historical loss data from carriers using SortSpoke's specialized insurance LLM. The system extracts claim details, loss amounts, and dates from variable loss run formats, enriches data with standardized coding, and integrates with actuarial systems for risk assessment.

### Statement of Value Analysis

Commercial insurers automate SOV processing for property schedules and equipment lists. SortSpoke extracts building addresses, values, and coverage details from multi-page spreadsheets and PDFs, validates data consistency, and routes complex cases to underwriters for manual review.
