## Overview

Veryfi is an intelligent document processing (IDP) software company founded in 2017 and launched from the Y Combinator startup incubator in Silicon Valley. The company began as a personal expense app to help small business owners manage receipts, driven by the founders' personal experience with their mothers who worked as bookkeepers. Today, Veryfi has evolved into a comprehensive IDP platform with 52 full-time employees and $12.7 million in Series A funding raised in 2021.

The company's core mission is "Liberating the world from data entry" by automating the tedious process of manual data extraction from purchasing documents. While positioning itself as a general-purpose IDP platform, Veryfi's primary strength lies in spend management and expense reporting use cases. The company serves as an OEM provider to several top spend management software companies and has expanded into loyalty marketing programs, landing major clients including a top-three global food and beverage company and a top-five consumer packaged goods brand marketing agency.

Veryfi's competitive advantage stems from its extensive training data collected from years of receipt processing, giving it superior AI models compared to competitors who struggle to find sufficient valid training data for their systems.
