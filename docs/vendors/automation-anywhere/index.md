## Use Cases

### Banking Invoice Processing

Financial institutions deploy Automation Anywhere to automate accounts payable workflows. The platform [classifies](../../capabilities/classification/index.md) invoices, extracts line items and totals with 99% accuracy, validates data against purchase orders, and routes exceptions to human reviewers. The system learns from validation corrections to improve accuracy over time.

### Healthcare Claims Automation

Healthcare providers use Automation Anywhere to process insurance claims and medical documentation. The IDP system [extracts](../../capabilities/extraction/index.md) patient information, procedure codes, and billing data from forms and handwritten notes using ICR technology. Pre-processing improves image quality for scanned documents, while validation checks ensure compliance with healthcare regulations.

### Manufacturing Purchase Order Processing

Manufacturing companies implement Automation Anywhere to handle supplier purchase orders across multiple formats. The platform extracts order details from emails, PDFs, and web portals, validates information against inventory systems, and automatically processes routine orders while flagging anomalies for review.
