## News Review for automation-anywhere

# Automation Anywhere News Review

## Executive Summary

Automation Anywhere has positioned itself as an early adopter of emerging enterprise security standards by joining Okta's Cross App Access (XAA) protocol initiative alongside Box, Boomi, and Glean, demonstrating the company's focus on secure AI agent integration capabilities ([SiliconAngle](https://siliconangle.com/2025/09/25/okta-expands-identity-fabric-ai-agent-lifecycle-security-cross-app-access-verifiable-credentials/)). The company maintains its presence in multiple high-growth market segments, with analyst firms recognizing Automation Anywhere as a key player in both the hyper automation market projected to reach $208.48 billion by 2034 at 16.50% CAGR ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/09/19/3153315/28124/en/Hyper-Automation-Industry-Worth-Over-208-Billion-by-2034-Appian-Corporation-UiPath-and-Wipro-Limited-Dominate-the-Current-Landscape.html)) and the Digital Process Automation market expected to grow from $14.04 billion in 2024 to $36.01 billion by 2032 at 12.55% CAGR ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/09/18/3152193/0/en/Digital-Process-Automation-Market-Size-to-Hit-USD-36-01-Billion-by-2032-at-12-55-CAGR-Research-by-SNS-Insider.html)). Additionally, the company was identified among 70+ vendors in the emerging agentic AI ecosystem, indicating its relevance in the autonomous AI systems market where 10% of large enterprises currently deploy AI agents and 50% plan exploration within the next year ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/09/22/3154054/28124/en/Agentic-AI-Strategic-Intelligence-Research-Report-2025-Expansive-Opportunities-by-Enabling-Autonomous-Decision-making-Especially-in-Complex-Environments.html)).

## Key Developments

**Strategic Partnerships**: Automation Anywhere became an early supporter of Okta's Cross App Access (XAA) protocol, an open standard extending OAuth for secure agent-driven and app-to-app interactions. The XAA protocol shifts access control from individual applications to the identity layer, providing real-time visibility and policy-based enforcement while reducing user friction through pre-approved integrations ([SiliconAngle](https://siliconangle.com/2025/09/25/okta-expands-identity-fabric-ai-agent-lifecycle-security-cross-app-access-verifiable-credentials/)).

**Market Recognition**: Multiple analyst reports positioned Automation Anywhere among leading vendors in expanding automation markets, including recognition in the hyper automation space alongside IBM, UiPath, and Appian ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/09/19/3153315/28124/en/Hyper-Automation-Industry-Worth-Over-208-Billion-by-2034-Appian-Corporation-UiPath-and-Wipro-Limited-Dominate-the-Current-Landscape.html)), and inclusion among 20 leading Digital Process Automation vendors competing with UiPath, Blue Prism, IBM, and Microsoft ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/09/18/3152193/0/en/Digital-Process-Automation-Market-Size-to-Hit-USD-36-01-Billion-by-2032-at-12-55-CAGR-Research-by-SNS-Insider.html)).

## Market Context

The developments occur within a broader automation market experiencing double-digit growth rates, with the hyper automation segment projected to expand at 16.50% CAGR through 2034 and the Digital Process Automation market growing at 12.55% CAGR through 2032. The market is being driven by cloud adoption, low-code platform integration, and increasing demand for operational efficiency across industries, with BFSI leading adoption at 30.4% market share. The emergence of agentic AI represents a natural evolution for RPA vendors, creating both opportunities and competitive pressure to evolve traditional automation offerings toward autonomous decision-making systems.

## Strategic Implications

Automation Anywhere's early support for Okta's XAA protocol positions the company to offer enhanced security integration capabilities for AI agents in enterprise environments, potentially providing integration advantages over competitors not yet supporting the protocol. The company's consistent recognition across multiple analyst reports indicates maintained competitive positioning in expanding automation markets, though it faces intensifying competition from both pure-play RPA vendors and broader technology companies like IBM and Microsoft. The growing trend toward low-code solutions making automation accessible to SMEs suggests Automation Anywhere may need to address both enterprise and SME segments, while the increasing importance of process mining capabilities could influence future product development priorities.
