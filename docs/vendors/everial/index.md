## Use Cases

### Corporate Archives Management

Enterprises outsource legacy document storage to Everial's secure facilities, maintaining boxes of contracts, financial records, and corporate documents with indexed retrieval systems. When documents are needed, staff request specific files through Everial's portal, receiving either physical delivery or digital scans. The service reduces on-site storage costs while ensuring regulatory retention compliance.

### Historical Document Preservation

Museums, libraries, and cultural institutions digitize historical collections including books, ledgers, maps, and correspondence. Everial's manual processing handles fragile or damaged documents through video coding, while automated OCR processes standard materials. Digitized collections become searchable and accessible online while original materials return to climate-controlled storage.

### Healthcare Record Archiving

Medical facilities and healthcare providers archive patient records, imaging studies, and administrative documents meeting healthcare data retention regulations. The service combines physical storage for original records with digitization enabling electronic access for authorized medical staff. Secure destruction services handle documents reaching end-of-retention periods while maintaining compliance audit trails.
