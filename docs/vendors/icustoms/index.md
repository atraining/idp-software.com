## Overview

Founded by a former HMRC member, iCustoms delivers an AI-driven Trade Compliance Management Platform that automates customs declaration workflows for international trade businesses. The platform uses AI and [OCR](../../capabilities/ocr/index.md) for intelligent document processing, extracting keywords from commercial invoices, trade receipts, and bills of lading to auto-populate customs forms. Operating from London, iCustoms supports UK Customs Declaration Service (CDS) integration directly with HMRC systems. The platform processes declarations in 3 minutes with claimed 99% accuracy, helping organizations save up to 70% in time and costs while reducing human errors in customs compliance workflows.

## Use Cases

### Customs Broker Automation

Customs brokers processing high volumes of client shipments deploy iCustoms to automate declaration preparation. The platform ingests commercial invoices via email or API, extracts product descriptions, quantities, values, and origin countries, then pre-fills CDS forms. AI classification suggests HS codes based on product descriptions. Brokers review flagged exceptions, approve automated declarations, and submit electronically to HMRC. Integration eliminates manual data entry across multiple client accounts.

### Logistics Provider Compliance

Freight forwarders and 3PLs use iCustoms to ensure shipment compliance across borders. The system validates documentation completeness, calculates duties and VAT, generates customs declarations for UK imports/exports, and maintains audit trails. Real-time CDS connectivity provides immediate feedback on declaration acceptance or rejection. Automated workflows route exceptions to compliance teams while processing standard shipments touchlessly.

### E-Commerce Cross-Border Trade

Online retailers shipping to UK customers automate customs clearance by connecting iCustoms APIs to order management systems. Product catalog data maps to HS codes, order details flow to declaration forms, and duty estimates display at checkout. Automated declaration submission upon shipment creation speeds clearance, reducing delivery delays and improving customer experience for international orders.
