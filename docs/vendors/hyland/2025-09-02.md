# Hyland Software News Review

## Executive Summary

Hyland Software has made a significant strategic pivot toward AI-powered enterprise automation with the launch of two major platform components - the Enterprise Context Engine and Agent Mesh - as part of its Content Innovation Cloud platform, marking CEO Jitesh Ghai's vision to transform the company from a traditional content management provider into an AI-first enterprise automation platform. The Context Engine leverages graph analytics and the Model Context Protocol to create a unified view of organizational data by integrating ERP, CRM, and HR systems, while the Agent Mesh delivers industry-specific AI agents targeting healthcare, banking, insurance, government, and higher education sectors with full audit capabilities and minimal process reengineering requirements. This launch represents part of six new cloud services introduced this year, with four additional services planned for next year, positioning Hyland to compete directly in the growing agentic AI market while leveraging its existing customer relationships and domain expertise as a competitive differentiator against generic agent builders.
