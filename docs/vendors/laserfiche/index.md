## Use Cases

### Government Records Management

Municipal, state, and federal government agencies implement Laserfiche to modernize records management and citizen services. The platform digitizes paper documents including permits, licenses, public records, and administrative files with powerful capture tools and OCR technology. Records management capabilities enforce retention schedules, disposition rules, and legal holds in compliance with government regulations. Public-facing web portals enable citizens to submit applications, make requests, and access public information through self-service interfaces. Workflow automation streamlines approval processes, routes documents between departments, and manages public records requests with automatic redaction capabilities. Integration with GIS, payment systems, and other government applications creates a unified digital ecosystem. This implementation accelerates citizen service delivery through streamlined processes, ensures compliance with records regulations through consistent governance, improves transparency through searchable public records, and reduces operational costs through elimination of paper-based processes.

### Financial Services Process Automation

Banks, credit unions, and financial institutions utilize Laserfiche to automate document-intensive processes in lending, account services, and compliance operations. The platform creates digital workflows for loan origination, account opening, and client onboarding with electronic forms capturing customer information and supporting documentation. Automated document classification organizes and indexes incoming documents using AI-enhanced recognition. Integration with core banking systems, CRM platforms, and credit verification services creates straight-through processing with minimal manual intervention. Compliance features maintain audit trails, manage sensitive information, and enforce regulatory requirements including KYC and AML protocols. This approach reduces loan processing time through automated workflows, enhances customer experience through streamlined onboarding, strengthens compliance through consistent documentation and audit trails, and scales operations by handling higher transaction volumes without proportional staff increases.
