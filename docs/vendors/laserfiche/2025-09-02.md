# Laserfiche News Review

## Executive Summary

Laserfiche has positioned itself as a thought leader in workplace AI governance by releasing significant survey research revealing that 49% of American workers hide their AI usage from employers, with 46% admitting to pasting company information into public AI tools despite only 36% of organizations having clear AI policies in place. CEO Karl Chan leveraged these findings to frame the issue as a leadership challenge rather than a technology problem, advocating for IT-vetted, intuitive AI tools that balance employee productivity needs with enterprise security requirements. This strategic positioning creates a market opportunity for Laserfiche to promote their document processing solutions as secure, enterprise-grade alternatives to public AI tools while establishing the company as an authority on AI adoption challenges in the workplace.

**Strategic Market Positioning**: The company leveraged the survey findings to position itself as a solution provider for enterprise AI governance challenges, emphasizing the need for approved, secure AI tools that meet both productivity and compliance requirements.

## Market Context

The research highlights a significant AI governance gap in the broader Intelligent Document Processing market, where employee AI adoption is outpacing organizational policy development. This creates substantial opportunities for enterprise software providers like Laserfiche to offer structured, secure alternatives to public AI tools. The findings suggest that organizations with clear AI governance frameworks and approved tools may gain competitive advantages, particularly in document processing workflows where sensitive company information is frequently handled. The survey data supports growing market demand for enterprise-grade AI solutions that can satisfy both employee productivity needs and IT security requirements.

## Notable Quotes

**Karl Chan, CEO of Laserfiche**: "When employees feel like AI is their 'dirty little secret,' that's not a tech problem, it's a leadership one. Many employees are eager to embrace AI to work but often resort to unofficial tools when company-approved options are too limited or difficult to use. Innovative organizations can meet employee needs and unlock new potential by implementing guidelines, and adopting IT-vetted, intuitive AI tools that help employees reach productivity goals."

## Strategic Implications

Laserfiche's research-driven approach establishes the company as a thought leader in workplace AI governance, potentially driving increased demand for their document processing solutions as organizations seek to address the security risks associated with unauthorized AI tool usage. By framing the challenge as a leadership and policy issue rather than purely technological, Laserfiche positions itself to offer comprehensive solutions that address both governance and usability concerns.
