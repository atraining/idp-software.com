## Overview

Infrrd specializes in intelligent document processing (IDP) technology that combines artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing to automate data extraction from a wide variety of documents. The company's platform is designed to handle complex, unstructured, and semi-structured documents with high accuracy and minimal manual intervention.

Founded with a focus on solving data extraction challenges, Infrrd has developed proprietary AI technology that can understand document context, recognize patterns, and extract information with human-like comprehension. Their solutions are particularly effective for documents with varying layouts, complex tables, and contextual data points where traditional OCR or template-based approaches struggle.

Infrrd serves clients across multiple industries including insurance, healthcare, financial services, and supply chain, helping them transform document-intensive processes that have traditionally required significant manual effort. Their platform aims to reduce processing times, improve data accuracy, and free knowledge workers from repetitive data entry tasks.

## Use Cases

### Insurance Claims Processing

Insurance companies implement Infrrd's solution to transform their claims documentation workflow. The system automatically extracts critical information from claim forms, medical reports, invoices, and supporting documentation. The AI models understand different document layouts without requiring template creation for each form type. Extracted data is validated against business rules and integrated with claims management systems, significantly reducing processing time from days to minutes, improving accuracy, and enhancing customer satisfaction through faster claims resolution.

### Invoice Processing Automation

Finance departments use Infrrd to streamline accounts payable operations across diverse vendor invoices. The platform processes incoming invoices to extract header information, line items, tax details, and payment terms regardless of format or structure. The intelligent extraction understands context and relationships between data fields, enabling high accuracy even with vendor-specific invoice layouts. The solution integrates with ERP and accounting systems to automate approval workflows and payment processing, reducing costs per invoice processed and capturing early payment discounts.
