## Use Cases

### Municipal Records Management

Ontario municipalities implement FileHold with TOMRMS (Toronto Municipal Records Management System) for complete records lifecycle management. Clerks index bylaw documents, council minutes, building permits, and zoning applications with retention schedules. Automated workflows route approvals through department heads while maintaining compliance audit trails. Public records requests retrieve documents by metadata search without accessing physical archives.

### Quality Management Documentation

Manufacturing organizations manage ISO quality system documentation including standard operating procedures, work instructions, inspection reports, and corrective action records. Version control tracks document revisions, electronic signatures capture approvals from quality managers, and automated distribution notifies staff of procedure updates. Search capabilities quickly locate current versions of controlled documents during audits.

### Contract Lifecycle Management

Corporate legal departments store, track, and manage contracts from negotiation through renewal. Metadata extraction during import populates fields for parties, effective dates, terms, and renewal deadlines. Automated workflows route contracts for review by legal, finance, and executive stakeholders. Calendar reminders alert contract managers of upcoming expirations, enabling proactive renegotiation or termination.
