## Use Cases

### Enterprise-Wide Content Management

Organizations implement OnBase as their central content repository to consolidate information across departments and systems. The platform captures documents from multiple sources (scanners, email, fax, electronic forms) and automatically classifies and indexes them using OCR, barcode recognition, and machine learning technologies. Users access documents through intuitive interfaces, with permissions controlled by role-based security. Integration with line-of-business applications provides content in context, allowing users to retrieve related documents directly from familiar systems like ERP, CRM, or EMR. Advanced search capabilities enable quick location of information across millions of documents using metadata, full-text, or combination searches. This approach eliminates information silos, reduces storage costs through elimination of duplicate content, improves security through centralized access controls and audit trails, and enhances productivity by providing immediate access to critical information regardless of location or device.

### Accounts Payable Automation

Finance departments utilize OnBase to transform invoice processing operations. The solution captures incoming invoices from multiple channels and automatically extracts key data including vendor information, invoice numbers, line items, amounts, and payment terms. Workflow automation routes invoices through configurable approval processes based on amount thresholds, departments, GL codes, or other business rules. Integration with ERP systems enables three-way matching against purchase orders and receiving documents, while exception handling workflows direct discrepancies to appropriate personnel for resolution. Dashboards provide real-time visibility into invoice status, bottlenecks, and processing metrics. This implementation reduces invoice processing costs by up to 80%, shortens cycle times from weeks to days, improves visibility into financial obligations, captures early payment discounts, and strengthens vendor relationships through timely, accurate payments.
