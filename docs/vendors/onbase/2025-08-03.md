## News Review for onbase

# OnBase News Review

## Executive Summary

Hyland has enhanced its OnBase platform with the launch of Agent Builder, a transformative AI-powered tool that enables organizations to build and deploy enterprise-grade AI agents for complex document processing workflows. This development, announced as part of Hyland's Content Innovation Cloud, represents a strategic pivot from traditional document management to AI-enhanced intelligent document processing, positioning OnBase to compete more effectively in the evolving IDP market by offering multiagent collaboration capabilities that automate time-consuming document reading and processing tasks while maintaining scalable human oversight options for gradual AI adoption without workflow disruption ([VMblog](https://vmblog.com:443/archive/2025/07/30/hyland-unveils-agent-builder-revolutionizing-business-workflows-with-ai-powered-multiagent-collaboration.aspx)).

## Key Developments

**Product Enhancement**: Hyland launched Agent Builder, a comprehensive AI agent development platform that seamlessly integrates with existing OnBase workflows. The platform supports both task-oriented and collaboration-oriented agents, includes industry-specific system prompts for financial services, insurance, and healthcare sectors, and can be deployed through low-code interfaces or advanced APIs. The solution enables organizations to automate document processing tasks, accelerate compliance checks, and reduce fraud risk while maintaining operational continuity ([VMblog](https://vmblog.com:443/archive/2025/07/30/hyland-unveils-agent-builder-revolutionizing-business-workflows-with-ai-powered-multiagent-collaboration.aspx)).

**Strategic Platform Evolution**: The Agent Builder launch represents Hyland's strategic move to transform OnBase from a traditional document management system into an AI-powered intelligent document processing platform, expanding its market reach into AI-driven workflow automation and positioning the company to address enterprise concerns about AI ROI through production-ready solutions rather than experimental implementations.

## Market Context

This development positions OnBase strategically within the rapidly evolving IDP market, where enterprise AI agent deployment for workflow automation and document processing is becoming increasingly critical. By offering multiagent collaboration capabilities integrated with existing document management systems, Hyland differentiates OnBase from traditional IDP solutions that rely primarily on OCR technology. The platform's focus on practical, manageable AI implementation addresses the growing enterprise demand for moving beyond AI experimentation to production-ready workflow automation solutions, potentially capturing market share from competitors who have not yet integrated comprehensive AI agent capabilities into their document processing platforms.

## Notable Quotes

Michael Campbell, Chief Product Officer at Hyland, emphasized the practical focus of the new platform: "Agent Builder makes context aware enterprise agents practical and manageable, so that organizations can realize the true benefits of AI augmentation while amplifying their human teams." Campbell further positioned the strategic value by stating, "With this new addition to the Content Innovation Cloud, we're helping organizations move from experimental AI to real-world solutions, enhancing decision-making and freeing up their teams to focus on higher-value work" ([VMblog](https://vmblog.com:443/archive/2025/07/30/hyland-unveils-agent-builder-revolutionizing-business-workflows-with-ai-powered-multiagent-collaboration.aspx)).

## Strategic Implications

The Agent Builder launch fundamentally repositions OnBase in the competitive landscape by transforming it from a traditional document management solution into an AI-enhanced intelligent processing platform. This strategic evolution enables Hyland to compete more effectively against pure-play IDP vendors while leveraging its existing customer base and document management expertise. The platform's emphasis on gradual adoption approaches and scalable human oversight addresses typical enterprise AI deployment challenges, potentially accelerating customer adoption and reducing implementation barriers. By focusing on industry-specific use cases and maintaining integration with existing OnBase workflows, Hyland has created a differentiated value proposition that could expand its addressable market while strengthening customer retention through enhanced platform capabilities.
