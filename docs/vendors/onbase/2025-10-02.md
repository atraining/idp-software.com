## News Review for onbase

# OnBase News Review

## Executive Summary

Hyland announced at Community Live 2025 that its OnBase platform will gain access to new AI-powered capabilities through the expanded Content Innovation Cloud, including the Enterprise Context Engine for knowledge graph overlays and Agent Mesh for chaining AI agents across business workflows, with the company emphasizing a "modernize without migration" strategy that allows existing OnBase customers to leverage these AI document processing capabilities without platform changes ([Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/hyland-community-live-2025-its-all-about-content-context-and-community/)).

## Key Developments

**Product Enhancements**: OnBase users will gain access to Hyland's Enterprise Context Engine, Agent Mesh, and Agent Builder tools through the Content Innovation Cloud platform. The Agent Builder tool is currently available for creating AI agents using natural language, with upcoming enhancements planned for observability and third-party application compatibility ([Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/hyland-community-live-2025-its-all-about-content-context-and-community/)).

**Platform Integration**: Hyland launched the Content Federation Service to connect OnBase installations with third-party systems including SharePoint Online and other ECM platforms, featuring secure connections and metadata mapping capabilities ([Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/hyland-community-live-2025-its-all-about-content-context-and-community/)).

**Strategic Architecture**: The company unveiled a cloud-native, AI-ready content repository that will be made available as open source through Alfresco Community GitHub, though OnBase customers can access these capabilities without migrating from their existing on-premises installations ([Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/hyland-community-live-2025-its-all-about-content-context-and-community/)).

## Market Context

These developments position OnBase within Hyland's broader strategy to compete in the AI-powered enterprise content management space while addressing the challenge of modernizing legacy document processing systems. The approach allows OnBase installations to participate in the growing enterprise adoption of AI agents for document processing and workflow automation without requiring costly platform migrations, targeting vertical markets including healthcare, government, and financial services.
