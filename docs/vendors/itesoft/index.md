## Use Cases

### Accounts Payable Automation

Finance departments implement Itesoft's solutions to transform their invoice processing operations. The system captures invoices from multiple channels including email, paper, and supplier portals, then applies intelligent recognition to extract key data such as vendor information, line items, amounts, and tax details. Business rules automatically validate the extracted data against ERP master data and purchase orders, flagging exceptions for review. The validated invoices flow through configurable approval workflows that route documents to appropriate approvers based on amounts, cost centers, or other business rules. Once approved, the system generates payment files and updates the accounting system. This comprehensive approach reduces processing costs by up to 80%, accelerates cycle times from weeks to days, improves supplier relationships through faster payments, and enhances visibility into financial obligations.

### Customer Onboarding Process Management

Financial institutions and service organizations use Itesoft to streamline their customer onboarding processes. The platform captures and processes application forms and supporting documentation such as identity proofs, income verification, and address documents. Advanced recognition extracts customer information while validation functions verify completeness and accuracy against business requirements. The system performs automated compliance checks including KYC (Know Your Customer) verification and anti-fraud screening. Workflow capabilities route applications through required approval steps while tracking status and managing service level agreements. Integration with core business systems ensures that new customer records are automatically created once all requirements are met. This approach accelerates onboarding from days to minutes, improves customer experience through faster service, and ensures regulatory compliance through consistent processing and comprehensive audit trails.
