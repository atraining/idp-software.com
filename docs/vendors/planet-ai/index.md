## Products

### Planet AI Vision Platform

Planet AI Vision Platform is a comprehensive visual recognition solution that enables businesses to build, deploy, and manage custom AI models for image analysis without extensive machine learning expertise. The platform provides an intuitive interface for training custom models using a company's own visual data, whether for object detection, classification, or anomaly detection tasks. Built on proprietary deep learning technology, the solution delivers high accuracy with relatively small training datasets compared to conventional approaches. The platform includes annotation tools for efficiently labeling training images, model performance analytics to evaluate accuracy, and version control for managing model iterations. Deployment options include cloud-based services, on-premises installation, or edge computing devices depending on business requirements. Integration capabilities allow for connection with existing enterprise systems through APIs and standard interfaces. By implementing the Planet AI Vision Platform, organizations can automate visual inspection processes, improve quality control accuracy, reduce dependence on manual image review, and deploy consistent visual analysis across operations while maintaining control of sensitive visual data.

### Planet AI Document Intelligence

Planet AI Document Intelligence is a specialized solution that leverages visual AI and machine learning to automate the extraction, classification, and processing of information from document images. The system combines computer vision, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and natural language processing to understand both the visual structure and textual content of documents. Advanced document classification capabilities automatically identify document types based on their visual characteristics and content patterns. Field extraction functionality locates and captures specific data points from semi-structured documents such as invoices, forms, and IDs without requiring rigid templates. The solution incorporates validation rules to verify extracted information against business logic, reference data, or mathematical checks. Integration with workflow systems enables straight-through processing for standard documents while routing exceptions for human review. By implementing Planet AI Document Intelligence, organizations can accelerate document processing times, reduce manual data entry costs, improve data accuracy, and enable staff to focus on higher-value activities rather than routine document handling.

### Planet AI Manufacturing Suite

Planet AI Manufacturing Suite is a specialized collection of visual AI solutions designed specifically for industrial and manufacturing environments to automate quality inspection and production monitoring. The suite includes pre-configured components for common manufacturing use cases including defect detection, assembly verification, and component identification. Computer vision models are optimized for factory environments, handling challenges such as variable lighting, diverse product orientations, and high-speed production lines. Edge computing capabilities enable deployment directly on production equipment with real-time analysis without requiring constant cloud connectivity. Integration with manufacturing execution systems (MES) and quality management systems creates closed-loop workflows where detected issues automatically trigger appropriate responses. The solution includes specialized tools for industrial users to label examples and train models without data science expertise. Visualization tools provide production personnel with clear indications of detected issues and quality metrics. By implementing the Manufacturing Suite, organizations can reduce defect escape rates through more consistent inspection, lower quality control costs by automating routine visual inspections, maintain production records with automatic visual documentation, and improve process understanding through quantitative analysis of visual production data.

## Use Cases

### Automotive Quality Inspection

Automotive manufacturers and suppliers implement Planet AI's visual recognition technology to automate quality control processes throughout production. The system deploys cameras at key inspection points along assembly lines to capture images of components, subassemblies, and finished products. AI models trained on both acceptable parts and known defects automatically identify quality issues including surface imperfections, missing components, incorrect assembly, and dimensional variations. Edge computing devices process images in real-time, providing immediate feedback to production systems without requiring cloud connectivity. Integration with manufacturing execution systems enables automatic tracking of quality metrics and triggering of appropriate responses when defects are detected. Historical analysis identifies patterns in defect occurrences to support root cause analysis and process improvement. This implementation significantly improves inspection consistency compared to human visual inspection, detects subtle defects that might be missed by manual processes, reduces inspection costs while enabling 100% inspection coverage, and provides quantitative data for continuous quality improvement initiatives.

### Retail Inventory Management

Retail organizations utilize Planet AI's technology to transform inventory management through automated visual recognition of products on store shelves and in warehouses. The solution processes images from fixed cameras, mobile devices, or autonomous robots that capture shelf and storage conditions throughout retail operations. AI models identify individual products, detect out-of-stock situations, recognize incorrect product placements, and assess planogram compliance without requiring RFID tags or barcode scanning. Integration with inventory management systems automatically updates stock levels and triggers replenishment workflows when shortages are detected. Analytics dashboards provide store managers with real-time visibility into shelf conditions, merchandising compliance, and inventory status across locations. This approach dramatically reduces the labor required for manual inventory checks, improves on-shelf availability through faster detection of stockouts, enhances merchandising compliance with automated planogram verification, and provides more accurate inventory data for supply chain optimization.

### Construction Site Monitoring

Construction companies implement Planet AI's visual recognition solutions to enhance site monitoring, safety compliance, and progress tracking across multiple projects. The system processes visual data from fixed cameras, drones, and mobile devices to create a comprehensive view of construction activities. AI models automatically identify safety violations including missing personal protective equipment, unauthorized access to restricted areas, and hazardous conditions requiring immediate attention. Progress monitoring functionality compares current site conditions against BIM (Building Information Modeling) plans to assess completion status and identify deviations from specifications. Equipment and material tracking capabilities maintain awareness of key assets across large construction sites. Integration with project management systems updates task status and generates notifications based on visual observations. This implementation enhances safety through continuous monitoring of compliance, improves project management with objective progress tracking, reduces disputes through visual documentation of site conditions, and enables more efficient resource allocation through better visibility into construction activities.
