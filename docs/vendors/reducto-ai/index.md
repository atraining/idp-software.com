## Use Cases

### Intelligent Invoice Processing

Finance departments implement Reducto.ai to transform their accounts payable operations. The platform automatically captures invoices received through multiple channels (email, EDI, supplier portals) and extracts key information including vendor details, invoice numbers, line items, tax amounts, and payment terms. Unlike template-based systems, Reducto's AI can recognize and process invoices from new vendors without configuration. The extracted data undergoes validation against business rules and ERP master data, flagging exceptions while allowing clean transactions to flow directly to approval workflows. Integration with financial systems enables straight-through processing for matched invoices while maintaining complete audit trails. This implementation reduces invoice processing costs by up to 75%, accelerates processing time from weeks to hours, improves early payment discount capture, and enhances visibility into financial obligations and cash flow forecasting.

### Contract Analysis and Management

Legal and procurement teams utilize Reducto.ai to streamline contract management processes. The solution automatically extracts key clauses, obligations, renewal dates, and commercial terms from various contract types. Natural language processing capabilities identify critical provisions even when expressed in different ways across document sets. The system creates structured datasets from contract repositories, enabling powerful search and analysis functions. Automatic alerts for expiration dates, renewal options, and obligation deadlines help prevent missed opportunities and compliance risks. Integration with contract lifecycle management systems enhances visibility and control throughout the contract process. This approach accelerates contract review by up to 80%, improves risk identification through comprehensive clause analysis, enhances compliance through systematic obligation tracking, and enables better commercial decisions through improved access to contract information.
