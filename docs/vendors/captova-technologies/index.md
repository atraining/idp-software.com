## Use Cases

### Government Secure Document Processing

Government agencies deploy Captova in SCIFs (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities) and SAPFs (Special Access Program Facilities) to process classified documents offline. The system operates on on-premise bare-metal servers without internet connectivity, processes intelligence documents and reports at 6,000 pages per minute, and trains AI models on-site using single document samples for immediate deployment.

### Accounting Automation with QuickBooks

Accounting firms and businesses use Scanov to automate expense management and accounts payable. The system captures data from supplier invoices, receipts, bills, and purchase orders, [extracts](../../capabilities/extraction/index.md) line items and payment details, exports both data and source document images directly to QuickBooks Online, and processes documents in milliseconds for real-time bookkeeping.

### High-Volume Enterprise Document Processing

Enterprises with large document volumes implement Captova IDP Engine for invoice processing, contract analysis, and regulatory documentation. The platform handles structured and semi-structured documents, generates JSON/CSV/XML output for ERP integration, detects errors in real-time with 95% accuracy, and scales to process 360,000 pages per hour on single server deployments.
