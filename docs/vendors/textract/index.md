## Overview

Amazon Textract is a machine learning (ML) service that automatically extracts printed text, handwriting, and structured data such as forms and tables from scanned documents. It goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) by understanding the context of the extracted data, making it easier to integrate into various applications and workflows. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])

## Key Features

* **Text and Handwriting Extraction**: Accurately extracts printed text and handwriting from documents.
* **Form and Table Recognition**: Identifies and extracts data from forms and tables, preserving the structure of the information.
* **Query-Based Extraction**: Allows users to specify queries to extract specific information without needing to know the document's structure.
* **Identity Document Analysis**: Extracts information from identity documents such as passports and driver's licenses.
* **Expense Analysis**: Processes invoices and receipts to extract relevant financial data.
* **Integration with AWS Services**: Seamlessly integrates with other AWS services like Amazon Comprehend, AWS Lambda, and Amazon S3 for building end-to-end document processing workflows. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2], [Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1], [Amazon Web Services, Inc.][3])

## Use Cases

* **Automated Data Entry**: Streamlines data entry processes by extracting information from forms and documents.
* **Document Archiving and Search**: Enhances document management systems by making scanned documents searchable.
* **Compliance and Auditing**: Facilitates compliance by extracting and organizing data required for audits.
* **Financial Document Processing**: Automates the extraction of data from invoices, receipts, and other financial documents.
* **Identity Verification**: Extracts and verifies information from identity documents for onboarding processes.([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][4], [Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2], [Amazon Web Services, Inc.][3], [Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1])

## Integration Workflow

Amazon Textract can be integrated into various workflows using AWS services:

1. **Document Ingestion**: Upload documents to Amazon S3.
2. **Data Extraction**: Use Amazon Textract to extract text, forms, and tables.
3. **Data Processing**: Process extracted data with AWS Lambda functions or Amazon Comprehend for further analysis.
4. **Storage and Retrieval**: Store processed data in databases like Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon RDS for easy retrieval and analysis.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Utilize Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and logging the processing workflows. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2], [Amazon Web Services, Inc.][3])
