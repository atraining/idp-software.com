## News Review for mulesoft

# MuleSoft News Review

## Executive Summary

MuleSoft has launched Agent Fabric, a platform for orchestrating and governing AI agents across enterprise environments, marking a strategic expansion beyond traditional integration into AI governance as agent adoption is projected to surge 327% over two years ([Computer Weekly](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/CW-Developer-Network/Salesforce-saddles-up-MuleSoft-Agent-Fabric-for-orchestration-governance)). The platform demonstrated strong performance within Salesforce's Q2 results, contributing to revenue upside through upfront licensing recognition while being highlighted by analysts as a strength alongside Platform and Tableau ([Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/reiteration/25/09/47505982/salesforce-delivers-uninspiring-quarter-but-signals-ai-driven-upside-ahead-says-analyst)). However, the company faced security challenges when its legacy DataLoader.io product became a template for sophisticated cyberattacks targeting Salesforce customers ([ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/battered-by-cyberattacks-salesforce-faces-a-trust-problem-and-a-potential-class-action-lawsuit/)). MuleSoft's Anypoint Platform continues to power retail digital transformation initiatives, with implementations creating three-tier API architectures for unified commerce experiences ([International Business Times](https://www.ibtimes.com/architect-connection-how-senthilkumar-bose-revolutionizing-retail-api-led-integration-3783173)), while Gartner analysts recommend customers consolidate MuleSoft and Slack licenses to optimize costs amid broader SaaS price increases of 9-25% annually ([The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/20/saas_license_negotiation_advice/)).

## Key Developments

**Product Launches**: MuleSoft launched Agent Fabric, featuring four core components - Agent Registry for cataloging, Agent Broker for routing, Agent Governance for security controls, and Agent Visualizer for monitoring, supporting MCP and A2A protocols ([Computer Weekly](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/CW-Developer-Network/Salesforce-saddles-up-MuleSoft-Agent-Fabric-for-orchestration-governance)).

**Financial Performance**: MuleSoft contributed to Salesforce's Q2 revenue upside through timing-driven upfront revenue recognition on licensed products, with analysts specifically citing strength in Platform, MuleSoft, and Tableau ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canaccord-lowers-salesforce-crm-target-180532182.html)).

**Security Incidents**: Cybercriminals created malicious imposter versions of DataLoader.io, originally developed by MuleSoft before its 2018 acquisition by Salesforce, to conduct sophisticated phishing attacks against enterprise customers ([ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/battered-by-cyberattacks-salesforce-faces-a-trust-problem-and-a-potential-class-action-lawsuit/)).

**Market Implementations**: The Anypoint Platform powered retail integration projects using three-tier API architecture deployed on Microsoft Azure, enabling unified commerce experiences and reducing time-to-market for new customer features ([International Business Times](https://www.ibtimes.com/architect-connection-how-senthilkumar-bose-revolutionizing-retail-api-led-integration-3783173)).

## Market Context

MuleSoft's expansion into AI agent orchestration positions the company to capitalize on the projected 327% surge in AI agent adoption over the next two years, with 40% of enterprise applications expected to include agents within a year. This move extends beyond traditional integration into AI governance, addressing emerging "agent sprawl" challenges as enterprises adopt multiple AI agents from different vendors. The retail sector implementations demonstrate continued demand for API-led connectivity solutions in digital transformation initiatives, while the security incidents highlight the elevated risks facing integration platforms as they become embedded in larger enterprise ecosystems.

## Notable Quotes

**Andrew Comstock, SVP and GM of MuleSoft, Salesforce**: "The reality is, most enterprises live in a multi-vendor world and that won't change with AI. Just as companies rely on countless applications across different ecosystems, they'll soon have AI agents from every SaaS provider and every major LLM. The strategic challenge isn't building a single agent, but enabling all of them to work together. MuleSoft Agent Fabric gives every organisation the ability to govern and orchestrate all their agents in a cohesive and trusted way" ([Computer Weekly](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/CW-Developer-Network/Salesforce-saddles-up-MuleSoft-Agent-Fabric-for-orchestration-governance)).

**Jo Liversidge, VP Analyst at Gartner**: "if you have separate licenses for MuleSoft and Slack – both owned by Salesforce – you're missing the chance to bargain for a single subscription" ([The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/20/saas_license_negotiation_advice/)).

**David Hynes Jr., Canaccord Genuity analyst**: "management has acknowledged that much of the revenue upside in the quarter was timing driven, signifying upfront revenue recognition on licensed products (MuleSoft/Tableau) and professional services" ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canaccord-lowers-salesforce-crm-target-180532182.html)).

**Former MuleSoft CEO**: "People need to decide whether they are a cruise ship or speedboat person. The speedboat is bumpy—you will probably get wet. But if you want smooth sailing by the pool, choose the cruise ship. Scale-ups are speedboats, not cruise ships" ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestowersclark/2025/09/17/why-ai-cant-replace-great-ceos-the-human-art-of-leadership/)).

## Strategic Implications

MuleSoft's launch of Agent Fabric represents a strategic pivot that could create new revenue streams and strengthen customer lock-in through AI governance capabilities, positioning the company as an early mover in AI agent orchestration. The strong financial performance within Salesforce's portfolio validates the 2018 acquisition strategy, while the security incidents underscore the need for enhanced security measures as MuleSoft's tools become more deeply embedded in enterprise environments. The retail implementations demonstrate the platform's continued relevance in digital transformation initiatives, though the company must balance its role as both a standalone integration platform and an integrated component of Salesforce's broader ecosystem strategy.

## Summary

MuleSoft's former product DataLoader.io became an unwitting template for cybercriminals targeting Salesforce customers, with threat actors creating convincing imposter versions of the data management application to trick users into granting unauthorized access to corporate Salesforce environments. The application, originally developed by MuleSoft before Salesforce's 2018 acquisition of the company, was replicated by hackers who used social engineering tactics to guide victims through installing malicious versions that enabled large-scale data theft from hundreds of organizations. This incident highlights the security challenges facing API and integration platform providers as attackers increasingly target third-party applications and OAuth tokens to gain access to enterprise systems.

## Summary

The article uses Salesforce's $6.5 billion acquisition of MuleSoft in 2018 as a case study demonstrating how competitor relationships in enterprise software can evolve into strategic partnerships through M&A.

### Article 6: SaaS vendors are hiking costs faster than inflation, but squeaky wheels can still get deals

**Source:** [View Full Article](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/20/saas_license_negotiation_advice/)

## Summary

MuleSoft customers are potentially missing cost optimization opportunities by maintaining separate licenses instead of negotiating consolidated Salesforce subscriptions that include both MuleSoft and Slack. This comes amid broader SaaS price increases of 9-25 percent annually, which exceed typical corporate IT budget growth of 2.8 percent. Gartner recommends customers begin renewal negotiations two years in advance and review all SaaS usage to identify consolidation opportunities, particularly within vendor families like Salesforce's portfolio that includes MuleSoft.
