## Use Cases

### Insurance Claims Processing

Insurance companies implement TCG Process solutions to streamline claims processing workflows. The platform captures incoming claims documents through multiple channels, automatically classifies them by type, extracts relevant information like policy numbers, claim details, and damage assessments, and routes them through appropriate approval workflows. Built-in validation checks verify the extracted data against policy databases while machine learning continuously improves extraction accuracy for complex forms. Integration with claims management systems enables straight-through processing for routine claims while identifying exceptions that require human review. This comprehensive approach reduces claims processing time by up to 70%, improves data accuracy to over 95%, enables consistent application of claims rules, and provides real-time visibility into claims status for both processors and customers.
