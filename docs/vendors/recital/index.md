## Products

### Recital Contracts

Recital Contracts is a comprehensive contract lifecycle management solution that streamlines the entire contract process from creation through negotiation, execution, and ongoing management. The platform provides a centralized repository for all contracts with powerful search capabilities to quickly locate specific agreements or clauses. Template management features enable legal teams to create and maintain standardized contract templates with approved language, reducing negotiation cycles and ensuring consistency. Automated workflow capabilities route contracts through customizable approval processes, with notifications and reminders to prevent bottlenecks. The solution includes e-signature integration for efficient execution and comprehensive reporting on contract status, cycle times, and other key metrics. By centralizing contract management, Recital Contracts helps organizations reduce contract cycle times, improve compliance with standard terms, enhance visibility into contractual relationships, and better manage renewal opportunities and obligations.

### Recital Intelligence

Recital Intelligence is an AI-powered contract analysis platform that extracts, categorizes, and interprets key information from contracts to provide actionable insights and risk assessments. The solution uses natural language processing and machine learning to automatically identify and extract critical provisions, obligations, rights, and potential risks from both legacy and new contracts. Users can quickly analyze large volumes of contracts against specific criteria or custom risk frameworks without manual review. The platform provides automated risk scoring based on organizational policies, flagging high-risk provisions for attorney review. Customizable dashboards visualize contract metrics, risk profiles, and obligation tracking across the contract portfolio. This intelligence layer enables organizations to better understand contractual exposure, identify non-standard terms, uncover optimization opportunities, and ensure compliance with changing regulations. By transforming contract data into business intelligence, Recital Intelligence helps legal and business teams make better informed decisions and proactively manage contractual relationships.

### Recital Document Automation

Recital Document Automation enables the rapid creation of accurate, compliant contracts and legal documents through an intuitive document assembly system. The solution allows organizations to convert complex legal documents into interactive templates with conditional logic, automated calculations, and guided questionnaires that control document generation. Business users can self-serve standard agreements by answering simple questions in a web interface, with the system automatically generating appropriate contract language based on their selections. Integration with corporate data sources allows for automatic population of entity information, pricing, and other data to eliminate manual entry errors. Approval workflows ensure that appropriate reviews occur for any non-standard terms, while maintaining an audit trail of all document changes. By automating document creation, the solution significantly reduces time-to-contract, ensures consistent use of approved language, minimizes errors in contract generation, and frees legal resources to focus on higher-value activities rather than routine document drafting.

## Use Cases

### Contract Migration and Analysis

Organizations implement Recital's platform during contract repository migrations or digital transformation initiatives to analyze legacy contracts and extract structured data. The system processes thousands of historical contracts including agreements, amendments, statements of work, and related documents across multiple formats. AI-powered extraction identifies and captures key information including parties, effective dates, termination dates, renewal terms, and critical clauses such as limitations of liability and data protection provisions. Classification algorithms categorize contracts by type, business unit, risk level, and other organizational taxonomies. Integration with contract management systems enables population of new repositories with both documents and structured metadata. This implementation creates a complete digital inventory of contractual relationships, uncovers previously hidden risks and obligations from legacy agreements, establishes baseline metrics for contract management improvement, and enables data-driven decision making about contractual relationships and future negotiations.

### Legal Department Transformation

Legal departments utilize Recital's solutions to modernize legal service delivery and improve operational efficiency. The platform implements standardized templates and clause libraries for routine agreements, allowing business users to self-serve common contract needs through guided workflows. Automated review capabilities pre-screen third-party contracts against acceptable parameters, routing only high-risk or non-standard provisions for attorney review. Integration with e-signature platforms and workflow systems creates a digital contracting process from request through execution. Analytics dashboards provide visibility into legal department workload, contract cycle times, negotiation patterns, and risk profiles across the contract portfolio. This approach reduces time spent on routine contract tasks through self-service and automation, improves response times to business contract requests, ensures consistent application of legal standards across agreements, and provides data-driven insights to optimize legal resource allocation and identify process improvement opportunities.

### Merger and Acquisition Due Diligence

Organizations leverage Recital's contract intelligence during M&A activities to accelerate due diligence and uncover contractual risks and opportunities. The system rapidly processes and analyzes the target company's contracts to identify material provisions, change of control restrictions, assignment limitations, and other clauses that might impact transaction value or integration. Automated extraction captures key terms including pricing structures, termination rights, exclusivity arrangements, and data protection obligations across the contract portfolio. Risk scoring highlights agreements requiring detailed attorney review based on customized risk frameworks. Customized reports summarize findings for different stakeholder groups including legal, finance, and business integration teams. This implementation accelerates due diligence timelines through automated initial review, uncovers hidden contractual risks that might affect valuation or deal structure, identifies revenue retention risks and opportunities in customer agreements, and provides structured data to support post-merger integration planning and contract harmonization efforts.
