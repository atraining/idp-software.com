## Use Cases

### HIPAA-Compliant Document Redaction

Healthcare providers and government agencies use ID Shield to redact protected health information from medical records, legal documents, and land records before public release. The system identifies names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and medical identifiers across document types without requiring templates. Redactions are permanently burned into files, preventing recovery. Staff review flagged areas through the verification interface before finalizing redacted documents.

### Laboratory Data Automation

Hospital systems deploy LabDE to process faxed COVID test results, pathology reports, and lab findings arriving as scanned documents. The platform extracts patient identifiers, test types, results, and reference ranges, then maps inconsistent result descriptions ("+", "POS") to standardized EMR values ("Positive"). Validated data transmits via HL7 interfaces to the correct patient records, eliminating manual transcription of lab backlogs.

### Government Records Management

County clerk offices automate indexing of land records, court documents, and vital records by extracting key metadata including parties, dates, case numbers, and document types. Extract Systems' classification engine determines document categories, routes files to appropriate departments, and populates database fields for public records search systems.
