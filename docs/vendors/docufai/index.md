# Docufai

Docufai is a generative AI document assistant from Ripcord that delivers instant answers from documents through natural language queries, supporting multilingual content without hallucination.

## Overview

Launched in beta in November 2023, Docufai is developed by Ripcord in Hayward, California. The platform uses large language models enhanced with integrated knowledge bases, logical rules, and structured inputs to provide accurate information retrieval from enterprise documents. Unlike content generation tools, Docufai focuses on accelerating access to existing information through natural language questioning and automatic summarization. The system processes documents in multiple languages, allowing users to query in any language regardless of the original document language. Docufai is built on Ripcord's document intelligence platform used by MUFG Bank, Warner Media, Coca-Cola, and the IRS, providing enterprise-grade security and scale.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Queries**: Users ask questions about documents in conversational language and receive instant answers with source references
- **Automatic Summarization**: Generates summaries of document content, highlighting key information without reading full documents
- **Multilingual Support**: Processes documents in any language and answers queries in the user's preferred language regardless of source document language
- **Hallucination Prevention**: Enhanced LLMs with knowledge bases and logical reasoning prevent fabricated answers, ensuring trustworthy information
- **Enterprise Security**: Built on Ripcord's platform with enterprise-grade security controls and data protection
- **Document Intelligence Foundation**: Leverages Ripcord's document processing infrastructure used by major enterprises and government agencies

## Use Cases

### Legal Discovery Acceleration
Law firms deploy Docufai to expedite document review during litigation. Attorneys query case documents using natural language, receiving instant answers with citations to specific pages and sections. Automatic summarization provides case overviews without reading thousands of pages, while multilingual capabilities handle international documents without translation delays.

### Insurance Policy Analysis
Insurance companies use Docufai to locate policy details and coverage information rapidly. Underwriters and claims adjusters ask questions about policy terms, exclusions, and coverage limits, receiving immediate answers from policy documents. The system eliminates time-consuming manual searches through lengthy policies, enabling faster claims decisions and customer service responses.

### Financial Document Review
Finance teams leverage Docufai for asset analysis, audits, and due diligence. Analysts query financial statements, contracts, and reports in natural language, extracting relevant figures and terms without manual document review. M&A teams conduct due diligence by asking questions across large document sets, accelerating transaction timelines while maintaining accuracy through hallucination prevention.
