## Use Cases

### M&A Due Diligence

Investment banks and private equity firms conduct acquisition due diligence by uploading financial statements, contracts, and corporate records to secure data rooms. Buyers review documents with OCR-enabled search, add annotations and questions, and track all access through audit logs. The platform maintains document version control and provides activity reports for transaction teams.

### Real Estate Transactions

Real estate investment firms manage property sales and acquisitions by organizing site plans, leases, inspection reports, and title documents in structured folders. The AI search capabilities help investors quickly locate specific clauses across hundreds of lease agreements. Translation features enable cross-border transactions with international buyers.

### Corporate Restructuring

Companies undergoing restructuring share confidential financial data, organizational charts, and legal documents with advisors and stakeholders. Administrators control document visibility by user group, watermark sensitive files, and generate compliance reports showing who accessed which documents and when.
