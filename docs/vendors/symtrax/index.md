## Use Cases

### ERP Document Management

Organizations implement Symtrax solutions to enhance document management capabilities within their ERP environments. The software captures documents generated by enterprise systems, applying consistent formatting, branding, and distribution rules based on document type and content. The system automatically distributes documents to appropriate recipients through preferred channels (email, print, fax, web) while maintaining comprehensive archives for audit and retrieval purposes. Business rules determine document routing, approval workflows, and retention policies to ensure compliance with organizational and regulatory requirements. This approach reduces document processing costs, improves delivery reliability, enhances document accessibility, and strengthens compliance capabilities through consistent application of document management policies.

### Accounts Payable and Receivable Automation

Financial departments utilize Symtrax technology to streamline accounts payable and receivable processes. The solution captures financial documents such as invoices and statements from multiple sources, extracts relevant data, and integrates with accounting systems to facilitate processing. For accounts payable, the system matches invoices with purchase orders and receiving documents, routing exceptions through appropriate approval workflows. For accounts receivable, the platform generates customer statements and payment reminders according to predefined schedules and business rules. Digital archiving maintains searchable records for audit and inquiry purposes. This implementation accelerates financial document processing, improves accuracy through automation, enhances visibility into financial operations, and strengthens vendor and customer relationships through more reliable document handling.
