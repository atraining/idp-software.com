## Use Cases

### Enterprise Content Management

Organizations implement OpenText Content Suite to establish a comprehensive enterprise content management strategy. The platform centralizes document storage and provides structured management for all content types across departments and processes. Advanced metadata capabilities and taxonomies organize information for easy retrieval, while version control ensures document integrity. Collaboration features enable secure sharing both internally and with external partners through controlled workspaces. Records management capabilities automatically apply retention policies based on content type and regulatory requirements. Integration with enterprise applications (ERP, CRM, HR systems) embeds content management directly into business processes. This implementation eliminates information silos, reduces discovery and compliance costs, improves productivity through immediate access to accurate information, and mitigates risk through consistent information governance.

### Intelligent Document Processing

Enterprises utilize OpenText Intelligent Capture to transform document-intensive operations. The solution automates the capture of documents from multiple channels (scan, email, fax, web) and extracts relevant data using advanced recognition technologies and machine learning. Classification engines automatically identify document types without templates, while extraction rules locate and capture specific data points with high accuracy. Validation workflows verify extracted information against business rules and existing systems, routing exceptions for human review. Integration with downstream systems enables straight-through processing for clean transactions. This approach dramatically reduces manual data entry, accelerates processing from days to minutes, improves data accuracy by eliminating keying errors, and enables staff to focus on higher-value activities rather than routine processing.
