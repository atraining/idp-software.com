# Extend

Extend is an AI-native document processing platform providing APIs for parsing, classification, extraction, and splitting of complex documents with specialized large language models.

## Overview

Founded in 2023 by Eli Badgio and Kushal Byatnal, Extend operates as a Y Combinator-backed document processing cloud platform serving technical teams building production document workflows. The company raised $17 million across seed and Series A rounds led by Innovation Endeavors in June 2025. Extend's platform uses specialized large language models and vision models designed specifically for complex document formats, handling tables, handwriting, and checkboxes with claimed 95%+ accuracy. Their customers include Chime, Brex, Flatiron Health, Opendoor, and Checkr for mission-critical document processing pipelines.

## Key Features

- **Specialized Vision Models**: Custom-built AI models for complex document layouts including large tables, handwritten content, and form elements
- **Document API Suite**: APIs for [document parsing](../../capabilities/ocr/index.md), [classification](../../capabilities/classification/index.md), [data extraction](../../capabilities/extraction/index.md), and document splitting
- **Adaptive Learning**: Memory system that learns from processed documents to improve accuracy on similar files over time
- **Autonomous Optimization**: AI agents that run experiments and automatically optimize extraction schemas
- **Markdown Conversion**: Transform documents into high-quality markdown format for LLM ingestion
- **Production-Ready Validation**: Data validation layer ensuring extracted information meets quality thresholds

## Use Cases

### Financial Document Processing

Fintech companies like Chime and Brex process loan applications, bank statements, and identity documents through Extend's APIs. The platform extracts account numbers, transaction histories, and personal information from varied document formats while handling poor-quality scans and handwritten annotations. Validated data flows into underwriting systems for credit decisions.

### Healthcare Records Extraction

Healthcare organizations including Flatiron Health automate medical record processing by extracting patient demographics, diagnoses, prescriptions, and lab results from clinical documents. The system handles complex medical forms with checkboxes, tables, and physician handwriting, structuring information for electronic health record integration.

### Real Estate Transaction Automation

Real estate platforms like Opendoor process property documents including contracts, disclosures, inspection reports, and title documents. Extend's vision models extract property details, terms, dates, and parties from multi-page PDFs with varied layouts. The learning system improves extraction accuracy as it processes similar property types and jurisdictions.
