## News Review for lexmark

# Lexmark News Review

## Executive Summary

Lexmark has emerged as the dominant player in the A4 multifunctional printer (MFP) segment with 40 models by Q4 2024, significantly outpacing competitors like Kyocera (31 models) and Brother (19 models) in a rapidly expanding market expected to reach $66.2 billion by 2033, according to [Astute Analytica's market analysis](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/25/3138603/0/en/Global-Multifunctional-Printer-MFP-Market-to-Reach-US-66-2-Billion-by-2033-Astute-Analytica.html). However, this market leadership comes amid integration challenges following Xerox's acquisition of Lexmark, with [Citi's August 2025 coverage initiation](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/citi-initiates-coverage-xerox-holdings-173004600.html) specifically noting that expected revenue growth from the Lexmark acquisition has yet to materialize, contributing to softened free cash flow expectations for the combined entity as the broader print industry faces continuous declines.

## Key Developments

**Product Portfolio Expansion**: Lexmark has established the industry's largest A4 MFP portfolio with 40 models by Q4 2024, positioning the company to capitalize on the market shift toward compact devices designed for small teams of one to five people in decentralized office environments.

**Integration Challenges**: The company's integration into Xerox Holdings faces execution hurdles, with revenue growth from the acquisition failing to meet expectations as of August 2025, according to Citi's analyst coverage.

**Market Positioning**: Lexmark has strategically aligned its product offerings with the industry trend favoring A4 devices over larger A3 models, as the A4 segment expanded from 214 models in H1 2023 to 239 by H2 2024 while A3 remained flat at 215 models.

## Market Context

Lexmark's developments occur within a multifunctional printer market experiencing a fundamental shift toward smaller, more versatile devices suited for hybrid work environments. The global MFP market is projected to grow at a 5.8% CAGR through 2033, driven primarily by demand for A4 devices that serve decentralized office setups. However, this growth potential is tempered by broader industry headwinds, including continuous declines in the core print business that are affecting all major players and creating pressure for diversification into new revenue streams and technology solutions.

## Strategic Implications

Lexmark's extensive A4 portfolio positions the company advantageously in the fastest-growing segment of the MFP market, potentially enabling significant market share gains as organizations continue adopting hybrid work models requiring smaller, team-oriented printing solutions. However, the company's strategic success remains closely tied to Xerox's ability to execute the integration effectively and realize anticipated synergies. The delayed revenue materialization from the acquisition suggests potential challenges in market execution or synergy capture that could impact Lexmark's growth trajectory. Success in overcoming these integration hurdles while leveraging its A4 market leadership will be critical for Lexmark's role in Xerox's broader transformation strategy and competitive positioning in an evolving print industry landscape.

## Summary

Lexmark has emerged as the A4 MFP portfolio leader with 40 models by Q4 2024, significantly outpacing competitors like Kyocera (31 models) and Brother (19 models) in a market segment that's experiencing rapid growth. This positioning aligns perfectly with the industry trend toward A4 devices for small teams of one to five people in decentralized office setups, as the overall A4 MFP market expanded from 214 models in H1 2023 to 239 by H2 2024. With the global MFP market expected to reach $66.2 billion by 2033 and A4 devices becoming the preferred choice for hybrid work environments, Lexmark's extensive portfolio variety positions them strategically to capture market share in the fastest-growing segment of the multifunctional printer industry.

**Source:** [View Full Article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/citi-initiates-coverage-xerox-holdings-173004600.html)

## Summary

Lexmark's integration into Xerox Holdings faces challenges as revenue growth from the acquisition has yet to materialize, according to Citi's August 2025 coverage initiation with a 'Hold' rating. The integration occurs amid broader industry headwinds with continuous declines in the core print business affecting the entire sector. While the acquisition holds strong potential as part of Xerox's restructuring efforts, the delayed revenue realization contributes to softened free cash flow expectations and highlights execution risks in the company's strategic transformation initiatives.
