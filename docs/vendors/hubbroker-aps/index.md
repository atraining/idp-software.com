## Use Cases

### E-Commerce Order Integration

Online retailers using Shopify, Magento, or OpenCart integrate with HubBroker to automate order flow from web store to accounting and fulfillment systems. Customer orders trigger EDI messages transmitting to warehouse management systems for picking and shipping. Invoice data posts automatically to e-conomic or Dinero accounting, while shipment notifications return to the web store for customer tracking updates.

### PEPPOL E-Invoicing Compliance

European businesses comply with PEPPOL e-invoicing mandates by routing invoices through HubBroker's network. The platform converts internal ERP invoice formats to PEPPOL BIS specifications, validates message structure, and transmits through access points to customer PEPPOL IDs. Purchase invoices arrive via PEPPOL, undergo validation, and import to Microsoft Dynamics or SAP for three-way matching and payment.

### Multi-Platform ERP Integration

Enterprises running multiple ERP systems across business units synchronize master data and transactions through HubBroker. The platform extracts customer records from SAP headquarters, transforms to target format, and updates regional Visma and Microsoft Dynamics instances. Real-time syncing maintains data consistency while customizable mappings handle schema differences between systems.
