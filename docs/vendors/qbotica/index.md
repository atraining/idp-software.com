## Products

### QBot Document Intelligence

QBot Document Intelligence is Qbotica's flagship intelligent document processing platform designed to automatically extract, validate, and process information from complex documents. The solution employs advanced AI and machine learning to understand document context, classify document types, and identify relevant data fields without requiring extensive template configuration. The platform can process various document formats including invoices, contracts, forms, applications, and correspondence across multiple channels such as email, scanned paper, and digital submissions. Built-in validation rules automatically verify extracted data against business rules, reference databases, or mathematical checks to ensure accuracy. The system's continuous learning capabilities enable it to improve recognition accuracy over time based on user corrections and feedback. Integration with existing business systems allows for seamless data transfer to ERP, CRM, or other enterprise applications. By automating document processing, QBot Document Intelligence helps organizations reduce manual handling costs, accelerate processing times, improve data accuracy, and enhance compliance with documentation requirements.

### QBot Process Automation

QBot Process Automation is Qbotica's comprehensive robotic process automation solution that enables organizations to automate repetitive, rule-based business processes across applications and systems. The platform provides tools for process discovery, automation design, deployment, and management with minimal coding requirements. Visual process designers allow business users to map out workflows and create automation scripts through an intuitive interface. The solution includes both attended bots that work alongside humans and unattended bots that operate independently to execute tasks around the clock. Advanced orchestration capabilities manage bot scheduling, workload distribution, and exception handling across the automation ecosystem. Integration with Qbotica's document intelligence capabilities creates end-to-end automation for document-centric processes. Performance analytics provide insights into automation effectiveness, processing volumes, and potential bottlenecks. By implementing process automation, organizations can achieve significant operational efficiencies, reduce processing costs, improve service consistency, minimize human error, and free staff from routine tasks to focus on higher-value activities.

### QBot Analytics

QBot Analytics provides comprehensive visibility into document processing and automation performance through intuitive dashboards and reporting tools. The solution collects and analyzes data from Qbotica's document intelligence and process automation platforms to generate actionable insights. Real-time dashboards display key performance indicators including processing volumes, accuracy rates, exception frequencies, and automation efficiency. Trend analysis tracks performance metrics over time to identify patterns, bottlenecks, or improvement opportunities. Customizable reports allow organizations to focus on specific metrics relevant to their business objectives or compliance requirements. Predictive analytics capabilities forecast future processing volumes and resource needs based on historical patterns. Process mining functionality identifies additional automation opportunities by analyzing existing workflows and user interactions. By leveraging these analytics, organizations gain deeper understanding of their operational performance, make data-driven decisions about process improvements, quantify the ROI of their automation initiatives, and continuously optimize their document processing and workflow automation efforts.

## Use Cases

### Intelligent Invoice Processing

Finance departments implement Qbotica's solutions to automate the capture, validation, and processing of supplier invoices across multiple formats and channels. The system automatically classifies incoming invoices, extracts key data including header information, line items, tax details, and payment terms without requiring predefined templates for each vendor format. Validation rules automatically verify extracted information against purchase orders, receiving documents, and vendor master data. Straight-through processing routes clean invoices directly to approval workflows while flagging exceptions for review based on configurable business rules. Integration with accounting systems and ERP platforms enables automated posting of approved invoices and payment initiation. Robotic process automation extends the solution to handle related tasks such as vendor statement reconciliation and payment status inquiries. This implementation significantly reduces invoice processing costs, accelerates processing cycles from days to hours, improves data accuracy through elimination of manual keying errors, captures more early payment discounts through faster processing, and frees accounting staff to focus on analysis and vendor relationships rather than transaction processing.

### Healthcare Claims Processing

Healthcare organizations utilize Qbotica's intelligent automation to streamline the processing of medical claims and related documentation. The platform automatically extracts and validates information from various claim forms including patient demographics, diagnosis codes, procedure codes, service dates, and billing amounts. Machine learning models recognize patterns in claims documentation, identifying potential coding errors, missing information, or compliance issues before submission to payers. Automated workflow routes claims through appropriate verification steps based on payer requirements, claim complexity, and identified risk factors. Integration with electronic health record systems and practice management software ensures consistency between clinical documentation and billing information. Analytics dashboards track key metrics including claim volumes, processing times, rejection rates, and reimbursement patterns. This approach accelerates revenue cycles through faster, more accurate claims submission, reduces denial rates through improved initial claim quality, optimizes staff productivity by automating routine processing tasks, and provides data-driven insights to improve coding practices and reimbursement strategies.

### Customer Onboarding Automation

Financial services institutions implement Qbotica's technology to transform customer onboarding processes for banking, lending, and investment services. The system automates the capture and processing of application forms, identity documents, proof of address, income verification, and other supporting documentation required for new customer setup. Advanced document intelligence extracts relevant information while verifying document authenticity and consistency across submission packages. Automated workflows route applications through required verification steps including KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti-Money Laundering), and credit checks based on product type and risk assessment. Integration with core banking systems, CRM platforms, and third-party verification services creates straight-through processing for eligible applications. Exception handling workflows route complex cases or identified discrepancies to appropriate specialists for resolution. This implementation dramatically reduces onboarding times from days to minutes for standard applications, improves customer experience through faster service activation, ensures consistent application of compliance requirements, and reduces processing costs while enabling staff to focus on customer engagement rather than administrative tasks.
