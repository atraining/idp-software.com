## News Review for edgeverve

# EdgeVerve Systems News Review

## Executive Summary

EdgeVerve Systems demonstrated continued market expansion and strategic positioning during this period through two key developments: securing PT Bank CTBC Indonesia as a new client for its Finacle Digital Banking Suite deployment on a cloud-hosted model, and establishing thought leadership in the emerging agentic AI market through CTO Arvind Rao's strategic positioning piece. The Indonesian banking deployment, announced September 9, 2025, represents EdgeVerve's ongoing expansion in the Asian financial services market and validates its cloud-based delivery model for a subsidiary of Taiwan's CTBC Group ([source](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/stock-markets/infosys-shares-gain-4-board-to-consider-buyback-on-sept-11/article70028556.ece)). Simultaneously, the company positioned itself in the agentic AI space through executive thought leadership, targeting healthcare, retail, insurance, and supply chain sectors as enterprises transition from reactive automation to autonomous decision-making systems ([source](https://www.techradar.com/pro/beyond-automation-the-future-of-intelligent-work-with-agentic-ai)). These developments align with market predictions that 25% of GenAI enterprises will deploy agentic AI pilots in 2025, rising to 50% by 2027, while EdgeVerve benefits from parent company Infosys' financial stability amid potential share buyback considerations.

## Key Developments

**Strategic Client Wins**: EdgeVerve's Infosys Finacle division secured PT Bank CTBC Indonesia for deployment of its digital banking solution suite using a cloud-hosted model. The implementation serves a subsidiary of Taiwan's CTBC Group, announced on September 9, 2025 ([source](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/stock-markets/infosys-shares-gain-4-board-to-consider-buyback-on-sept-11/article70028556.ece)).

**Thought Leadership Positioning**: EdgeVerve established its strategic direction in agentic AI through a comprehensive thought leadership piece authored by CTO Arvind Rao, targeting applications across healthcare, retail, insurance, and supply chain management sectors ([source](https://www.techradar.com/pro/beyond-automation-the-future-of-intelligent-work-with-agentic-ai)).

**Technology Strategy Evolution**: The company articulated a strategic shift from traditional automation to autonomous decision-making systems, positioning itself in the emerging agentic AI market segment ahead of predicted enterprise adoption acceleration.

## Market Context

EdgeVerve's developments occur within a favorable market environment where Deloitte predicts 25% of GenAI enterprises will deploy agentic AI pilots in 2025, increasing to 50% by 2027. The company's early positioning in agentic AI aligns with this growth trajectory while its continued success in Asian banking markets demonstrates sustained demand for cloud-based financial technology solutions. The parent company Infosys' consideration of share buybacks indicates financial strength that supports EdgeVerve's competitive positioning and client acquisition capabilities in enterprise markets.

## Notable Quotes

Arvind Rao, Chief Technology Officer, Edge Platforms at EdgeVerve, articulated the company's strategic vision: "Today the question is no longer about what AI can automate, but rather, what outcomes AI can achieve." This statement, made in the context of discussing evolution from traditional automation to agentic AI capabilities, defines EdgeVerve's strategic shift toward outcome-focused AI solutions rather than task automation ([source](https://www.techradar.com/pro/beyond-automation-the-future-of-intelligent-work-with-agentic-ai)).

## Strategic Implications

EdgeVerve's dual approach of securing traditional banking technology deployments while positioning for next-generation agentic AI markets demonstrates a balanced growth strategy. The Indonesian banking win validates the company's cloud-hosted delivery model and strengthens its Asian market presence, providing immediate revenue and market validation. Simultaneously, the agentic AI positioning through executive thought leadership establishes early market presence in a rapidly growing segment, potentially capturing market share as enterprises transition from reactive AI tools to proactive AI agents. The combination of proven banking technology success and forward-looking AI strategy positions EdgeVerve to serve both current enterprise needs and emerging autonomous system requirements.
