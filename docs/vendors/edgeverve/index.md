## Use Cases

### Commercial Insurance Underwriting

Insurance carriers deploy XtractEdge to process new business applications by extracting policy details, risk assessments, and applicant information from submission documents. The system handles varied document formats from brokers, validates data completeness, and feeds extracted information into underwriting systems for risk evaluation and pricing decisions.

### Financial Document Processing

Banks and financial institutions automate loan application processing by extracting data from income statements, tax returns, credit reports, and supporting documentation. AssistEdge RPA bots retrieve documents from email and portals, trigger XtractEdge for data extraction, validate information against credit policies, and route applications for human review when exceptions occur.

### Invoice and AP Automation

Enterprises process vendor invoices across multiple formats and languages by combining XtractEdge extraction with AssistEdge workflow automation. The system captures invoice data, matches against purchase orders and contracts, flags discrepancies, and posts approved invoices to ERP systems with minimal manual intervention.
