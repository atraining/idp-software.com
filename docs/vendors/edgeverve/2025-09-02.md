# EdgeVerve Systems News Review

## Executive Summary

EdgeVerve Systems has significantly strengthened its market position through a strategic partnership with Mastercard, integrating the Finacle banking platform with Mastercard Move's global payment infrastructure to enable cross-border transactions across 200+ countries and 150+ currencies, reaching 95% of the world's banked population ([Electronic Payments International](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/infosys-mastercard-payments-access/)). This collaboration positions EdgeVerve's Finacle as a comprehensive "composable banking platform" that reduces traditional implementation complexity and costs for financial institutions seeking global payment capabilities, while the company also gained industry recognition as a key player in the rapidly expanding RPA market projected to reach $211.06 billion by 2034 ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/18/3135131/0/en/Robotic-Process-Automation-Market-Size-to-Hit-USD-211-06-Billion-by-2034-Driving-Enterprise-Efficiency-and-Cost-Savings-Through-Automation.html)). The Mastercard partnership represents a strategic evolution for EdgeVerve beyond traditional document processing into comprehensive financial services infrastructure, capitalizing on growing global remittances where Asia accounts for nearly half of global inflows in 2024 ([Finextra](https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/106871/infosys-and-mastercard-collaborate-to-scale-cross-border-payments)).

## Key Developments

**Strategic Partnership**: EdgeVerve secured a high-impact collaboration with Mastercard to integrate Finacle with Mastercard Move's payment services, enabling financial institutions to access cross-border payment capabilities across 200+ countries and 150+ currencies with significantly reduced implementation time and resources ([Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/infosys-shares-in-focus-after-partnering-with-mastercard-to-boost-cross-border-payments/articleshow/123575766.cms)).

**Product Enhancement**: The Finacle platform has been positioned as a "composable banking platform" that combines core banking functionality with integrated global payment processing, moving beyond traditional banking software to offer comprehensive financial services including saving, paying, borrowing, and investing capabilities ([Electronic Payments International](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/infosys-mastercard-payments-access/)).

**Market Recognition**: EdgeVerve was identified among key players in the global RPA market analysis alongside major vendors like UiPath and Automation Anywhere, validating its position in the competitive automation landscape ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/18/3135131/0/en/Robotic-Process-Automation-Market-Size-to-Hit-USD-211-06-Billion-by-2034-Driving-Enterprise-Efficiency-and-Cost-Savings-Through-Automation.html)).

## Market Context

The developments position EdgeVerve to capitalize on the growing demand for seamless cross-border payment solutions, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region where remittances account for nearly half of global inflows in 2024 ([Finextra](https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/106871/infosys-and-mastercard-collaborate-to-scale-cross-border-payments)). The partnership addresses financial institutions' prioritization of digital payment system advancements as key customer touchpoints, while the broader RPA market evolution toward hyperautomation and AI-enhanced intelligent automation creates opportunities for EdgeVerve to compete in an increasingly sophisticated landscape where traditional rule-based processing is evolving toward AI-driven intelligent document processing ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/18/3135131/0/en/Robotic-Process-Automation-Market-Size-to-Hit-USD-211-06-Billion-by-2034-Driving-Enterprise-Efficiency-and-Cost-Savings-Through-Automation.html)).

## Notable Quotes

**Sajit Vijayakumar, Chief Executive Officer, Infosys Finacle**: "At Infosys Finacle, we are committed to inspiring better banking by helping customers save, pay, borrow and invest better.

## Strategic Implications

The Mastercard partnership represents a strategic pivot for EdgeVerve from traditional document processing toward comprehensive financial services infrastructure, strengthening its competitive position against other banking platform providers by offering pre-integrated cross-border payment solutions rather than requiring custom integrations. This positions EdgeVerve to serve as a key digital infrastructure provider for global financial services, potentially expanding its international market reach through Mastercard's extensive network while addressing the growing demand for reduced implementation complexity in banking technology. The company's recognition in the RPA market analysis alongside major vendors validates its position in the competitive automation landscape, though it must continue evolving toward AI-enhanced solutions and cloud-native platforms to maintain relevance in the rapidly advancing intelligent automation sector.
