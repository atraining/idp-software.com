## Overview

Operating for 35 years, Groupe T2i develops modular software solutions accelerating digital transformation strategies for French organizations. The company's flagship product Youdoc delivers electronic document management with electronic signature, digital paraphers, and ERP integration capabilities. Additional products include HR Café (human resources portal), Notys (expense reports and absence management), Citizen (municipal ERP), and Meeting (meeting management software). In August 2024, T2i France acquired IRIS France, expanding their document management capabilities. Groupe T2i serves enterprises and public administrations requiring compliance with French legislation and cloud or on-premise deployment options.

## Use Cases

### Enterprise Document Workflow

Corporations deploy Youdoc to manage invoices, contracts, internal correspondence, and administrative documents with automated routing workflows. The system integrates with SAP or Oracle ERP, extracting invoice data and posting to accounting ledgers after approval. Electronic signatures capture executive approvals on contracts while maintaining audit trails. Employees access documents through web portals or mobile apps regardless of location.

### Municipal Administration

French municipalities implement the Citizen ERP to manage procurement cycles, budget planning, and citizen services. The system handles purchase requisitions from department heads, routes for approval through finance, and tracks expenditures against budgets. Document management capabilities archive council minutes, permits, and regulatory filings with retention schedules meeting French archival requirements.

### HR Document and Process Management

Human resources departments use HR Café and Notys to digitize employee records, onboarding documents, performance reviews, and leave requests. Employees submit expense reports through Notys with receipt attachments, routing to managers for approval. The platform calculates reimbursements and integrates with payroll systems. Leave balances update automatically when absence requests receive approval.
