## Use Cases

### Law Firm Document Management

Law firms implement NetDocuments as their central repository for client and matter-related content. The platform organizes documents, emails, and other files within workspaces structured around matters, clients, or practice areas. Document profiling captures essential metadata for later retrieval, while version control maintains complete history of document changes with the ability to compare or restore previous versions. Email management capabilities allow attorneys to file communications directly from Outlook into the appropriate matter. Collaboration features enable secure sharing both internally and with clients through ClientPortal. Advanced search capabilities help attorneys quickly locate precedents and relevant work product across the entire document repository. This implementation enhances attorney productivity through faster document access, improves client service through organized matter files, reduces risk through consistent information governance, and facilitates knowledge reuse through powerful search capabilities.

### Corporate Legal Department Content Governance

Corporate legal departments utilize NetDocuments to establish comprehensive information governance for legal content. The platform provides secure management of contracts, litigation documents, legal opinions, and corporate records with role-based security controls. Workflow automation streamlines contract review processes, approval pathways, and document routing. Integration with enterprise systems like CRM, ERP, and HR platforms creates a unified information ecosystem for legal matters. Records management capabilities enforce retention policies based on document type and regulatory requirements. Collaboration features enable secure work with outside counsel within controlled environments. This approach enhances compliance through consistent governance, improves legal operations efficiency through automation, strengthens security for sensitive legal information, and creates a single source of truth for legal content across the organization.
