## Use Cases

### Retail Pharmacy Prescription Processing

Pharmacy operations implement ScriptScan solutions to streamline prescription intake and processing. The system captures prescriptions from multiple sources (paper, fax, electronic) and automatically extracts key information including patient details, prescribed medications, dosages, and physician instructions. Advanced recognition technology interprets even difficult handwriting with high accuracy, while validation against drug databases identifies potential errors or interactions. Integration with pharmacy management systems enables direct transfer of verified prescription data, eliminating manual data entry and reducing the risk of transcription errors. This approach accelerates prescription processing by up to 70%, improves dispensing accuracy through automated verification, reduces pharmacist workload by automating routine tasks, and enhances patient safety through more thorough validation of prescription details.

### Long-Term Care Medication Management

Long-term care facilities utilize ScriptScan technology to manage complex medication regimens for residents. The solution processes prescriptions and medication orders from multiple providers, maintaining comprehensive medication profiles for each resident. The system identifies potential duplications or interactions across prescriptions from different specialists, while ensuring compliance with facility formularies and insurance requirements. Automatic tracking of prescription renewals generates timely alerts for physicians and staff to prevent medication lapses. Integration with electronic health records and medication administration systems creates a seamless documentation flow from prescription to administration. This implementation improves medication safety through comprehensive verification, enhances regulatory compliance through complete documentation, reduces administrative burden on nursing staff, and provides better continuity of care through improved information sharing between providers, pharmacy, and care teams.
