### Government Information Management

Government agencies implement Objective Nexus to establish comprehensive information governance across departments. The platform provides records management capabilities that automatically enforce retention schedules and disposition rules based on record classification. Workflow automation streamlines approval processes, correspondence management, and case handling. Integration with existing systems creates a unified view of information while maintaining appropriate security controls. Mobile access enables field staff to retrieve and capture information on-site. The solution supports GDPR, FOI/FOIA, and other regulatory requirements through built-in compliance tools. This implementation improves service delivery through faster information access, reduces compliance risk through consistent governance, enhances transparency through comprehensive audit trails, and increases productivity through automation of routine processes.

### Secure Cross-Organization Collaboration

Organizations utilize Objective Connect to securely share sensitive information with external stakeholders. The platform creates protected workspaces where internal and external participants can collaborate on documents with granular permission controls. Integration with internal content management systems allows seamless sharing while maintaining governance policies. Comprehensive audit logs track all activity including views, edits, and downloads for compliance purposes. Automated expiry settings ensure temporary access is properly terminated when no longer needed. This approach eliminates insecure email attachments, provides complete visibility into external sharing activities, maintains control over sensitive information even when shared externally, and simplifies compliance reporting through detailed audit trails.
