    Taiger signs a collaboration agreement to deepen during the next five years in the application of IA for banking processes
    September 18, 2022  juanjo.misis  Comments Off
    TAIGER is garnering the trust of top companies in banking, legal, and debt recovery sectors with its advanced intelligent document processing technology
     
    The acceleration by these companies in the use of AI algorithms continues to grow exponentially. Within this context, solutions for automatic classification, data extraction of any kind of documents and acceleration of supervision tasks by back offices are being incorporated into day-to-day operations.
    
    Since its creation, TAIGER has been developing its own algorithms focused on the development of intelligent document processing (IDP) through its Omnitive IDP platform.  The possibility of training its own models has been the differential piece evaluated by the client in the selection process of this tool. 
    
    The signing of this agreement joins other use cases previously developed in Spain and LATAM for entities such as BBVA, Santander, la Caixa, Banregio, Garrigues or KRUK with the aim of continuing to deepen in new applications of AI. 
    
    These agreements reinforce the companyâ€™s commitment to the strategy defined at the end of 2021 to concentrate its resources in the intelligent document processing sector and its growth expectations in the markets where the company is currently located in order to undertake its development strategy in new markets such as the USA in the near future.

Taiger provides AI-driven solutions that focus on extracting meaning and insights from unstructured documents and information sources. The company has developed proprietary technologies that combine natural language processing, machine learning, and semantic understanding to automate information-intensive processes that traditionally required human intelligence.

Founded with a strong research background, Taiger has created solutions that go beyond basic OCR and template-based approaches to truly understand document context and meaning. Their technology can interpret complex documents, extract relevant information, and make intelligent decisions based on the content, mimicking human cognitive processes at scale.

Taiger serves organizations across multiple industries, with particular strength in financial services, government, and legal sectors. Their solutions are designed to help organizations reduce manual document processing, improve data extraction accuracy, accelerate processing times, and enable more sophisticated information management capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Semantic Understanding**: AI that comprehends document meaning and context
- **Natural Language Processing**: Advanced linguistic analysis capabilities
- **Hybrid AI Approach**: Combination of rule-based and machine learning techniques
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Identification of entities, relationships, and facts
- **Document Classification**: Intelligent categorization of document types
- **Data Extraction**: Context-aware information capture from complex documents
- **Validation Intelligence**: Smart verification of extracted information
- **Process Automation**: End-to-end workflow for document-centric processes
- **Enterprise Integration**: Connections with business systems and repositories
- **Multi-Language Support**: Processing capabilities across different languages

## Use Cases

### Intelligent Document Processing

Organizations implement Taiger's solutions to transform how they handle complex documents. The technology automatically identifies document types regardless of format or structure, then extracts relevant information while understanding context and relationships between data points. The system validates extracted information against business rules and existing data sources, flagging exceptions that require human review. Integration with enterprise systems enables straight-through processing for standard documents while maintaining detailed audit trails. This approach reduces document processing costs by up to 80%, improves accuracy compared to manual processing, accelerates document handling from days to minutes, and enables staff to focus on higher-value activities rather than data entry.

### KYC and Customer Onboarding

Financial institutions utilize Taiger's technology to streamline customer onboarding and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. The solution automatically processes identity documents, proof of address, financial statements, and other required documentation, extracting customer information with high accuracy. The system performs complex validation against both internal and external data sources to verify customer identity and meet regulatory requirements. Workflow automation routes applications through appropriate approval steps while maintaining comprehensive audit trails for compliance. This implementation significantly reduces onboarding time from days to hours, improves compliance through consistent application of verification procedures, enhances customer experience through faster service delivery, and reduces operational costs associated with manual document review.
