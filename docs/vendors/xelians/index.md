## Use Cases

### Comprehensive Records Management

Organizations implement Xelians' hybrid archiving solution to manage both physical and electronic records with a unified approach. The system provides a centralized inventory of all documents regardless of format, with consistent classification, retention rules, and access controls. Physical archives are stored in Xelians' secure facilities with barcode tracking and climate control, while electronic documents are maintained in their digital archiving platform with preservation guarantees. A web portal enables authorized users to search across both physical and digital collections, with options to request physical document retrieval or access digital copies instantly. This implementation creates a complete records management ecosystem, ensures regulatory compliance through consistent retention management, optimizes storage costs by leveraging appropriate media for different document types, and improves information accessibility through unified search capabilities.

### Healthcare Information Management

Healthcare institutions utilize Xelians' specialized services to manage sensitive patient records and medical documentation. The solution includes secure physical storage for legacy paper records with strict access controls and chain of custody tracking. Digitization services convert paper records into electronic formats with high-quality image capture and OCR processing to enable text searchability. The electronic archiving system maintains clinical documentation with integrity controls and audit trails to meet healthcare compliance requirements. Integration with hospital information systems enables contextual access to patient documents directly from clinical applications. This approach enhances patient care through improved information access, ensures compliance with health data regulations, optimizes clinical workflows through integrated document access, and facilitates the transition to electronic health records while maintaining access to historical information.

### Banking Document Transformation

The service includes secure management of physical financial records with strict retention compliance and disaster recovery provisions.

Business process outsourcing handles routine document processing tasks such as account opening, loan documentation, and compliance verification. The electronic document management system enables workflow automation for approval processes and exception handling.
