Full Disclosure: Since 2016, Iâ€™ve been bootstrapping an IDP product and have seen just how confusing the intelligent document processing market can be.

In 2024, I came across the domain idp-software.com and decided to use it as a space to collect and share straightforward, unbiased information about this complex market.

This repository includes providers regardless of their size or marketing budget. The focus is placed on actual capabilities rather than market position. 

**To minimize personal bias, I created the initial content using AI.** 

I welcome indie hackers!
