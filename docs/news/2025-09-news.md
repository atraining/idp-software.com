# IDP Market Update: September 2025 Roundup

The intelligent document processing (IDP) market reached a critical inflection point in September 2025, as the industry confronted the reality gap between generative AI promises and practical business outcomes. This period marked a decisive shift toward AI realism, with vendors and enterprises alike acknowledging implementation challenges while pivoting toward more pragmatic agentic AI systems. The month witnessed intensified consolidation pressure as cloud platform providers entered the IDP space through strategic integrations, fundamentally altering the competitive landscape for traditional document processing vendors.

## AI Realism Replaces Generative AI Hype

September 2025 became defined by a sobering reassessment of generative AI capabilities in document processing. The most significant development was ABBYY's comprehensive survey of 1,200 senior managers across six countries, revealing that one-third of businesses found generative AI model training significantly more difficult than anticipated. This research validated growing industry skepticism about AI overpromising, with ABBYY's Senior Director of AI Maxime Vermeir declaring that "businesses spent money on Gen AI tools that promised more than they can provide."

The market's evolution from generative AI to agentic AI represented a fundamental shift in strategy. Rather than pursuing broad AI capabilities with uncertain outcomes, vendors increasingly focused on autonomous systems with defined boundaries and measurable business impact. This transition acknowledged the "garbage in, garbage out" principle that ABBYY's Marlene Wolfgruber emphasized remains critical in AI implementations, particularly as autonomous systems operate with greater independence.

## Platform Consolidation Disrupts Traditional Market Dynamics

The most significant competitive development was Box's full integration of Alphamoon technology into its Box Extract platform, creating a comprehensive intelligent document processing solution targeting established players. Industry analyst Alan Pelz-Sharpe explicitly identified this move as positioned to compete with "rivals such as Kofax, Abbyy and Hyland Software," signaling that cloud content management platforms now view IDP as core functionality rather than complementary services.

Box Extract's launch with advanced OCR capabilities, including handwriting detection, table extraction, and document graph functionality, demonstrated how platform providers leverage existing customer relationships and integrated workflows to challenge standalone IDP vendors. This consolidation trend represented a strategic threat to traditional vendors, as cloud platforms offer faster deployment, lower total cost of ownership, and seamless integration with existing enterprise systems.

## Enterprise Automation Market Reaches New Maturity

The automation market demonstrated remarkable growth momentum, with the hyper automation segment projected to expand from $45.27 billion in 2024 to $208.48 billion by 2034 at a 16.50% CAGR. [Automation Anywhere](/vendors/automation-anywhere/index.md) positioned itself strategically by joining Okta's Cross App Access (XAA) protocol initiative, enabling secure AI agent integration across enterprise systems. This partnership with Box, Boomi, and Glean demonstrated the industry's focus on interoperability and security as AI agents become more autonomous.

Large enterprises continued driving market growth, representing 68.4% of the automation market and showing increasing sophistication in AI implementation approaches. The shift toward agentic AI reflected enterprise demand for measurable outcomes and controlled autonomy, moving beyond experimental generative AI implementations toward production-ready systems with defined business value.

## Financial Performance Reveals Market Polarization

September's financial landscape showed stark performance differences across vendors. [Appian](/vendors/appian/index.md) emerged as a standout performer with Q2 2025 revenue growth of 16.5% to $170.64 million, exceeding analyst estimates and demonstrating the strength of platforms that successfully integrated AI capabilities with proven workflow automation.

Conversely, [Adobe](/vendors/adobe/index.md) faced significant investor skepticism, with stock declining 19% year-to-date amid concerns about AI revenue conversion. Multiple analyst downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Piper Sandler reflected growing scrutiny of vendors unable to demonstrate concrete revenue metrics from AI investments. Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss highlighted the "growing gap between the company's promises about AI and the revenue numbers that were showing up in its Digital Media ARR."

## Ethical AI and Regulatory Compliance Emerge as Differentiators

The period saw increased emphasis on responsible AI development as regulatory requirements intensified. Vendors positioning themselves as advocates for ethical AI practices gained competitive advantages, with ABBYY's thought leadership on data quality and controlled AI autonomy resonating with enterprises facing compliance challenges.

This trend toward responsible AI development created opportunities for vendors that could demonstrate transparent decision-making processes and explainable AI outcomes. As agentic AI systems gained greater autonomy, the importance of defined boundaries, reliable data processing, and human accountability became critical differentiators in vendor selection processes.

## Technology Innovation Focuses on Practical Implementation

Innovation efforts shifted from broad AI capabilities toward practical implementation solutions. The emphasis on agentic AI systems reflected market demand for autonomous decision-making within controlled parameters, moving beyond the experimental phase of generative AI toward production-ready systems with measurable business impact.

Cloud-based deployments captured 61.6% of the automation market, reinforcing the importance of platform integration and seamless deployment capabilities. Vendors demonstrating faster time-to-value and lower implementation complexity gained competitive advantages in an increasingly sophisticated buyer market.

## Market Outlook and Strategic Implications

September 2025 established new market realities that will define the IDP industry's trajectory. The shift from generative AI hype to agentic AI practicality reflects market maturation, with vendors required to demonstrate concrete business value rather than experimental capabilities. The entry of cloud platform providers through strategic integrations creates existential pressure for traditional IDP vendors to justify their standalone positioning.

Winners in this evolving landscape combine AI innovation with practical business value, offering solutions that integrate seamlessly with existing enterprise workflows while maintaining the reliability and explainability required for regulated industries. The growing emphasis on ethical AI and regulatory compliance creates differentiation opportunities for vendors that can demonstrate responsible AI development and transparent decision-making processes.

As the industry moves toward the final quarter of 2025, the distinction between experimental AI capabilities and production-ready business solutions becomes increasingly critical for vendor survival and growth. Organizations that successfully balance innovation with measurable outcomes, while addressing enterprise requirements for security, compliance, and integration, are positioned to thrive in this rapidly evolving market landscape.
