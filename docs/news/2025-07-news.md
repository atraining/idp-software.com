# IDP Market Update: July 2025 Roundup

The intelligent document processing (IDP) market is experiencing explosive growth and significant transformation in July 2025, with projections showing the sector expanding from $10.6 billion in 2025 to an astounding $66.7 billion by 2032, according to [Forbes analysis](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidprosser/2025/07/30/turning-data-into-insight-with-document-processing-start-ups/). This remarkable 30% annual growth rate is being driven primarily by generative AI advances, fundamentally reshaping how organizations approach document automation.

## Major Strategic Moves Reshape the Landscape

The month saw several landmark developments that signal a maturing market. Most notably, [Xerox](/vendors/xerox/index.md) completed its [$1.5 billion acquisition of Lexmark](/vendors/lexmark/index.md), removing the printer company from Chinese ownership and resolving regulatory barriers that had restricted Lexmark's US market access. This consolidation reflects broader industry trends toward vertical integration and comprehensive workflow solutions.

In a significant validation of the sector's potential, [DataSnipper](/vendors/datasnipper/index.md) became the first European Union unicorn of 2024, reaching a $1+ billion valuation for its AI-powered audging platform that transforms traditional manual audit processes into streamlined, automated experiences.

## AI Integration Accelerates Across Platforms

Leading vendors are rapidly integrating artificial intelligence capabilities to stay competitive. [ABBYY](/vendors/abbyy/index.md) received Newsweek's AI Impact Award for Best Outcomes in Accounting, with implementations delivering approximately 50% labor cost reductions for clients. The company's positioning reflects the critical shift from traditional OCR to AI-powered document understanding.

[Aptean](/vendors/aptean/index.md) launched GenAI Query, a mobile-first conversational intelligence feature that enables users to ask natural-language questions about business data without coding requirements. CEO TVN Reddy emphasized this represents "the difference between staring at a dashboard and having a direct, insightful conversation with your business."

## Government and Enterprise Adoption Surges

The government sector is embracing IDP solutions at an unprecedented pace. [DocuSign](/vendors/docusign/index.md) secured a major government contract through GSA's OneGov program, offering federal agencies 70% discounts on eSignature services through January 2027, with over three dozen agencies already using the platform.

Enterprise adoption is equally robust. [HCLTech](/vendors/hcltech/index.md) delivered market-leading revenue growth of 8.1% year-over-year, significantly outpacing competitors like TCS (1.3%) and Wipro (0.8%), while [EXL](/vendors/exl/index.md) reported strong Q2 2025 results with revenue of $514.5 million and raised full-year guidance to $2.050-2.070 billion.

## Competitive Dynamics Intensify

The market is witnessing increasing competition from both traditional players and AI-native startups. According to Forbes analysis, established players like [ABBYY](/vendors/abbyy/index.md), [Appian](/vendors/appian/index.md), [UiPath](/vendors/uipath/index.md), IBM, and [Microsoft](/vendors/microsoft/index.md) face pressure from well-funded startups like Retab, which raised $3.5 million to target non-technical users with self-serve solutions.

[UiPath](/vendors/uipath/index.md) faces mixed analyst sentiment despite beating Q1 earnings expectations with $356.62 million in revenue (6.4% growth), as the company navigates the transition from traditional RPA to AI-powered automation.

## Technological Innovation Continues

Innovation remains fierce across the sector. [Hyland](/vendors/hyland/index.md) unveiled Agent Builder, enabling organizations to build and deploy enterprise-grade AI agents for complex workflow automation. Chief Product Officer Michael Campbell noted the platform "makes context aware enterprise agents practical and manageable."

[Automation Anywhere](/vendors/automation-anywhere/index.md) secured first-mover advantage by becoming one of the initial vendors in AWS Marketplace's new AI Agents and Tools category, launching four enterprise-focused AI agents for financial analysis, content generation, sentiment analysis, and talent scouting.

## Market Outlook and Challenges

Despite the optimistic growth projections, challenges remain. The sector faces potential volatility, with Gartner warning that 40% of agentic AI projects may be scrapped by 2027 due to cost concerns and unclear value propositions.

However, the fundamentals remain strong. Organizations are increasingly recognizing that AI-powered information management can deliver quantifiable ROI, with some vendors like [OpenText](/vendors/opentext/index.md) targeting $1 billion in cost savings over 10 years through intelligent document processing.

As we move deeper into 2025, the IDP market stands at a crucial inflection point. The convergence of mature AI technologies, enterprise demand for automation, and competitive pressure from new entrants is creating unprecedented opportunities for organizations that can successfully navigate this rapidly evolving landscape. The winners will be those who can balance innovation with practical business value, transforming the promise of intelligent document processing into measurable operational improvements.
