    === "Wikipedia"
    
        A technology called automatic document processing or sometimes intelligent document processing (IDP) emerged as a specific form of Intelligent Process Automation (IPA), combining artificial intelligence such as Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Intelligent Character Recognition (ICE) to extract data from several types documents.

    === "Gartner"
    
        Gartner defines intelligent document processing (IDP) solutions as specialized data integration tools enabling automated extraction of data from multiple formats and varying layouts of document content. IDP solutions ingest data for dependent applications and workflows, and can be provided as a software product and/or as a service.

    === "IBM"
    
        Intelligent document processing is designed to extract business critical data, enabling better, faster decision-making and driving business performance. [Source](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/intelligent-document-processing)
    
    === "Amazon AWS"
    
        Intelligent document processing (IDP) is automating the process of manual data entry from paper-based documents or document images to integrate with other digital business processes. [Source](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/intelligent-document-processing/)
    
    === "Microsoft"
    
        Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) is a software solution that captures, transforms, and processes data from documents (e.g., e-mail, text, Word, PDF, or scanned documents). Using AI technologies such as computer vision, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and machine/deep learning, the extracted data can be analyzed, categorized, transformed, and exported to external systems in an end-to-end process.

Full Disclosure: Since 2016, Iâ€™ve been bootstrapping an IDP product and have seen just how confusing the intelligent document processing market can be.

In 2024, I came across the domain idp-software.com and decided to use it as a space to collect and share straightforward, unbiased information about this complex market.

This repository includes providers regardless of their size or marketing budget. The focus is placed on actual capabilities rather than market position. 

**To minimize personal bias, I created the initial content using AI.** 

I welcome indie hackers!
