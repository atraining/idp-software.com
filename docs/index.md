    === "Microsoft"
    
        Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) is a software solution that captures, transforms, and processes data from documents (e.g., e-mail, text, Word, PDF, or scanned documents). Using AI technologies such as computer vision, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and machine/deep learning, the extracted data can be analyzed, categorized, transformed, and exported to external systems in an end-to-end process.
