## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude are changing how documents are processed. In Intelligent Document Processing (IDP), they replace rigid rule-based systems with flexible, general-purpose models – ideal for handling diverse document types.

## Why LLMs Are Useful

LLMs understand context, not just keywords. That allows them to extract fields, summarize content, or classify documents with little to no training. Some advantages include:

- **Less manual setup**: LLMs adapt quickly to new document formats.
- **Language and layout flexibility**: They work well across multiple languages and layouts.
- **Summarization**: Long texts can be condensed into short, useful summaries.

## What Makes It Difficult

Despite their strengths, there are limits:

- **Performance costs**: Large models need powerful hardware.
- **Data privacy**: Sensitive info must be protected, especially in cloud setups.
- **Transparency**: It's often unclear why a model made a decision.

## Example: ERPA (2024)

The ERPA model, developed in 2024 for legal texts, combines OCR with a fine-tuned LLM. It performs well on complex, unstructured contracts – outperforming older, rule-based systems.

## Conclusion

LLMs offer a new level of flexibility and power in IDP. While they’re not perfect, their strengths in generalization, summarization, and multilingual support make them a valuable tool for modern document workflows.
