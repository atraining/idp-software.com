# Document Classification

Document classification is the process of automatically categorizing documents into predefined classes based on their content, structure, and visual features.

## Overview

Document classification assigns documents to one or more categories using their textual content, layout patterns, and visual characteristics. This fundamental capability enables automated document routing, processing workflows, and information organization in enterprise systems. Unlike text-only classification, document classification considers multimodal information including layout structure, visual elements, and document formatting.

## Core Components

### Feature Extraction

Methods for extracting relevant information from documents:

- **Text Features**: N-grams, TF-IDF, word embeddings, and contextual representations
- **Layout Features**: Spatial positioning, bounding boxes, and structural patterns
- **Visual Features**: Image-based representations from document scans or PDFs
- **Metadata Features**: File properties, creation date, author information

### Classification Approaches

Techniques for assigning documents to categories:

- **Rule-Based Classification**: Using predefined rules and patterns
- **Traditional Machine Learning**: Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forests
- **Deep Learning Models**: CNNs, RNNs, Transformers
- **Multimodal Methods**: Combining text, layout, and visual information
- **Vision-Language Models**: Joint learning of visual and textual features

### Document Representation

Converting documents into processable formats:

- **Bag-of-Words**: Frequency-based text representation
- **Embeddings**: Dense vector representations of text and layout
- **Image Representations**: CNN-based feature maps from document images
- **Graph Representations**: Document structure as graph networks
- **Hybrid Representations**: Combined text, layout, and visual encodings

### Class Assignment

Strategies for determining document categories:

- **Single-Label Classification**: Assigning one category per document
- **Multi-Label Classification**: Assigning multiple categories per document
- **Hierarchical Classification**: Organizing categories in taxonomies
- **Zero-Shot Classification**: Categorizing unseen document types
- **Few-Shot Classification**: Learning from limited examples

## Key Technologies

### Traditional Approaches

- **Naive Bayes Classifiers**: Probabilistic classification based on Bayes' theorem
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Maximum margin classification
- **Decision Trees and Random Forests**: Tree-based ensemble methods
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: Instance-based classification
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear classification with probabilistic output

### Deep Learning Approaches

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: For image-based document classification
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: For sequential text processing
- **Transformers**: BERT, RoBERTa for contextual text understanding
- **Vision Transformers (ViT)**: For document image classification
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: For structured document representation

### Multimodal Approaches

- **LayoutLM**: Pre-trained model combining text and layout (94.42% on RVL-CDIP)
- **LayoutLMv2/v3**: Enhanced versions with improved visual understanding
- **TechDoc**: Multimodal architecture integrating CNNs, RNNs, and GNNs
- **BERT + EfficientNet**: Combined text and image classification
- **DocLLM**: Layout-aware generative model for documents

## Use Cases in IDP

### Invoice and Receipt Classification

Automatically categorizing financial documents by type, vendor, or department for routing to appropriate processing workflows.

### Legal Document Categorization

Classifying contracts, briefs, motions, and other legal documents into document type categories for case management and compliance.

### Medical Record Organization

Sorting patient records, lab results, discharge summaries, and prescription forms into standardized categories for electronic health record systems.

### Email and Correspondence Management

Categorizing incoming emails, letters, and messages by department, urgency, or topic for automated routing and response prioritization.

### Form Type Identification

Distinguishing between different form types (tax forms, applications, surveys) to trigger appropriate extraction and validation workflows.

### Technical Documentation Classification

Organizing patents, research papers, technical manuals, and specifications by subject matter, using systems like International Patent Classification.

## Key Challenges

- **Layout Variability**: Handling diverse document formats and templates within same class
- **Class Imbalance**: Dealing with unequal distribution of documents across categories
- **Multimodal Integration**: Effectively combining text, visual, and layout signals
- **Ambiguous Documents**: Resolving documents that could belong to multiple categories
- **Domain Adaptation**: Transferring models across different document domains
- **Low-Quality Images**: Classifying scanned documents with noise, blur, or low resolution
- **Label Noise**: Managing mislabeled training data in real-world datasets

## Best Practices

1. **Feature Engineering**: Extract domain-specific features relevant to classification task
2. **Multimodal Learning**: Leverage text, layout, and visual information together
3. **Transfer Learning**: Use pre-trained models like LayoutLM for better performance
4. **Data Augmentation**: Generate variations to handle layout and content diversity
5. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple classifiers for robust predictions
6. **Confidence Thresholding**: Flag low-confidence predictions for human review
7. **Active Learning**: Iteratively improve models by targeting uncertain examples
8. **Domain-Specific Training**: Fine-tune models on target document types

## Measuring Classification Quality

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Accuracy | Percentage of correctly classified documents |
| Precision | Ratio of true positives to predicted positives per class |
| Recall | Ratio of true positives to actual positives per class |
| F1-Score | Harmonic mean of precision and recall |
| Confusion Matrix | Distribution of predictions across classes |
| Top-K Accuracy | Percentage where correct class is in top K predictions |
