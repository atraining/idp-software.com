## Evaluating Capabilities

When evaluating IDP software capabilities, consider the following aspects:

- **Accuracy**: How accurately can the system perform the capability?
- **Scalability**: Can the capability handle large volumes of documents?
- **Adaptability**: How well does it adapt to variations in documents?
- **Training Requirements**: How much training data or configuration is needed?
- **Processing Speed**: How quickly can the capability process documents?
- **Integration Ease**: How easily does it connect with existing systems?
- **Security Features**: How well does it protect sensitive information?

Each capability page aims to provide this information to help you understand what to look for in IDP software solutions.
