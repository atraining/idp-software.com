Current Visual Document Understanding (VDU) methods outsource the task of reading text to off-the-shelf Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engines and focus on the understanding task with the OCR outputs. Although such OCR-based approaches have shown promising performance, they suffer from 1) high computational costs for using OCR; 2) inflexibility of OCR models on languages or types of documents; 3) OCR error propagation to the subsequent process. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel OCR-free VDU model named Donut, which stands for Document understanding transformer. As the first step in OCR-free VDU research, we propose a simple architecture (i.e., Transformer) with a pre-training objective (i.e., cross-entropy loss). Donut is conceptually simple yet effective. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we show a simple OCR-free VDU model, Donut, achieves state-of-the-art performances on various VDU tasks in terms of both speed and accuracy. In addition, we offer a synthetic data generator that helps the model pre-training to be flexible in various languages and domains.</p>"},{"location":"research/2022-10-06-Donut/#key-innovations","title":"Key Innovations","text":"<ol> <li>OCR-free Document Understanding: Donut eliminates the need for separate OCR processing, addressing issues of computational cost, language/domain inflexibility, and error propagation.</li> <li>End-to-End Transformer Architecture: The model uses a simple but effective Transformer-based architecture with a visual encoder and textual decoder.</li> <li>Synthetic Data Generator (SynthDoG): A flexible data generation tool that enables pre-training for multiple languages and domains.</li> <li>Simple Pre-training Objective: Uses cross-entropy loss for next token prediction to learn reading text from document images.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"research/2022-10-06-Donut/#methodology","title":"Methodology","text":"<p>Donut consists of a Transformer-based visual encoder and textual decoder.

The platform enables analysts to create comprehensive dashboards that visualize key performance indicators across different business functions including sales, marketing, operations, and finance. Interactive filtering allows executives and decision-makers to segment data by time periods, product categories, geographical regions, or customer segments without requiring new reports for each perspective. Drill-down capabilities provide the ability to move from high-level summary metrics to detailed underlying data for root cause analysis. Automated data connections ensure dashboards always present current information with scheduled refreshes from enterprise data sources. Alert indicators highlight metrics that deviate from targets, trends that require attention, or forecasts that predict future challenges. This implementation significantly improves decision-making speed through more accessible data insights, enhances meeting productivity by enabling on-the-fly data exploration during discussions, increases report usage through more engaging presentation formats, and reduces reporting overhead by creating dashboards once rather than generating new reports for each analysis angle.</p>"},{"location":"vendors/chartpixel/#marketing-campaign-analytics","title":"Marketing Campaign Analytics","text":"<p>Marketing teams utilize Chartpixel to visualize campaign performance data and derive actionable insights for optimization. The platform consolidates data from various marketing channels including social media, email campaigns, digital advertising, and website analytics into unified visual dashboards.

Comparative views highlight performance differences between current and previous campaigns, different audience segments, or various creative approaches. Funnel visualizations map the customer journey from awareness to conversion, identifying drop-off points and optimization opportunities. Timeline charts show campaign performance evolution, correlating results with specific marketing activities or external events. This approach enables marketers to quickly identify high-performing channels and campaigns for budget reallocation, diagnose underperforming initiatives through visual pattern recognition, communicate results more effectively to stakeholders through clear visual narratives, and develop data-driven strategies based on comprehensive performance visualization rather than isolated metrics.</p>"},{"location":"vendors/chartpixel/#financial-analysis-and-reporting","title":"Financial Analysis and Reporting","text":"<p>Financial analysts and accounting professionals implement Chartpixel to transform complex financial data into clear, insightful visualizations that support both internal decision-making and external reporting.
