Understanding this history provides critical context for contemporary intelligent document processing systems and illuminates potential future developments in the field.</p> <p>The significance of OCR in the broader context of information technology cannot be overstated. As societal and business practices increasingly moved toward digital workflows throughout the late 20th and early 21st centuries, OCR technology became the crucial interface between legacy analog information stores and emerging digital systems. From governmental record digitization projects to business process automation to personal productivity applications, OCR has enabled the preservation, processing, and repurposing of trillions of pages of textual information that would otherwise remain locked in static formats.</p> <p>This historical analysis examines not only the technical evolution of OCR but also its expanding application domains, commercial ecosystem, and societal impact.

The IBM PC, introduced in 1981, featured an Intel 8088 processor running at 4.77 MHz with 16-64 KB of RAM\u2014computational resources that would be considered extraordinarily limited by modern standards. Image processing, a fundamental requirement for OCR, was particularly challenging within these constraints.</p> <p>Storage technology presented additional limitations. Hard disk drives were expensive and limited in capacity (typically 5-10 MB), while floppy disks offered even more constrained storage (360 KB for standard 5.25\" disks). These hardware limitations profoundly shaped OCR algorithm design, necessitating extreme efficiency in both computation and memory usage. The constraints of this computing environment explain many of the technical approaches and limitations of early 1980s OCR systems.</p>"},{"location":"capabilities/ocr/history/#template-matching-and-feature-extraction","title":"Template Matching and Feature Extraction","text":"<p>Early 1980s OCR systems relied primarily on template matching algorithms, comparing scanned character images against stored templates. This approach, while computationally efficient for the hardware of the era, suffered from substantial limitations\u2014particularly sensitivity to font variations, document quality issues, and character deformations[^2]. The template matching process typically involved:</p> <ol> <li>Binarization of the image (converting to black and white)</li> <li>Segmentation to isolate individual characters</li> <li>Normalization of character size and position</li> <li>Correlation-based comparison against a library of templates</li> <li>Selection of the highest-scoring match as the recognized character</li> </ol> <p>This approach worked reasonably well for fixed-font documents in good condition but degraded rapidly when confronted with font variations, quality issues, or unconventional layouts. Early commercial OCR systems often required documents to be prepared in specific fonts (like OCR-A or OCR-B) designed explicitly for machine readability.</p> <p>By the mid-1980s, feature extraction techniques began supplementing template matching, analyzing structural components of characters such as line intersections, closed loops, and stroke directions. This shift represented a crucial conceptual advancement: rather than attempting to match entire character images, systems began identifying invariant structural features that persisted across different fonts and styles.</p> <p>Researchers at Bell Laboratories made significant advances in feature extraction techniques during this period, developing algorithms that reduced dependency on exact template matches by focusing on invariant features of characters[^3]. Their work on topological feature analysis\u2014examining properties like the number of enclosed regions, endpoints, and junctions in character strokes\u2014proved particularly influential. This research direction laid important groundwork for the neural network approaches that would emerge decades later, as it began to frame character recognition as a problem of feature learning rather than template matching.</p>"},{"location":"capabilities/ocr/history/#hardware-specialization-and-acceleration","title":"Hardware Specialization and Acceleration","text":"<p>The computational demands of OCR in this era often necessitated specialized hardware.

Current Visual Document Understanding (VDU) methods outsource the task of reading text to off-the-shelf Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engines and focus on the understanding task with the OCR outputs. Although such OCR-based approaches have shown promising performance, they suffer from 1) high computational costs for using OCR; 2) inflexibility of OCR models on languages or types of documents; 3) OCR error propagation to the subsequent process. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel OCR-free VDU model named Donut, which stands for Document understanding transformer. As the first step in OCR-free VDU research, we propose a simple architecture (i.e., Transformer) with a pre-training objective (i.e., cross-entropy loss). Donut is conceptually simple yet effective. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we show a simple OCR-free VDU model, Donut, achieves state-of-the-art performances on various VDU tasks in terms of both speed and accuracy. In addition, we offer a synthetic data generator that helps the model pre-training to be flexible in various languages and domains.</p>"},{"location":"research/2022-10-06-Donut/#key-innovations","title":"Key Innovations","text":"<ol> <li>OCR-free Document Understanding: Donut eliminates the need for separate OCR processing, addressing issues of computational cost, language/domain inflexibility, and error propagation.</li> <li>End-to-End Transformer Architecture: The model uses a simple but effective Transformer-based architecture with a visual encoder and textual decoder.</li> <li>Synthetic Data Generator (SynthDoG): A flexible data generation tool that enables pre-training for multiple languages and domains.</li> <li>Simple Pre-training Objective: Uses cross-entropy loss for next token prediction to learn reading text from document images.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"research/2022-10-06-Donut/#methodology","title":"Methodology","text":"<p>Donut consists of a Transformer-based visual encoder and textual decoder.
