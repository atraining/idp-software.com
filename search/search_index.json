Current Visual Document Understanding (VDU) methods outsource the task of reading text to off-the-shelf Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engines and focus on the understanding task with the OCR outputs. Although such OCR-based approaches have shown promising performance, they suffer from 1) high computational costs for using OCR; 2) inflexibility of OCR models on languages or types of documents; 3) OCR error propagation to the subsequent process. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel OCR-free VDU model named Donut, which stands for Document understanding transformer. As the first step in OCR-free VDU research, we propose a simple architecture (i.e., Transformer) with a pre-training objective (i.e., cross-entropy loss). Donut is conceptually simple yet effective. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we show a simple OCR-free VDU model, Donut, achieves state-of-the-art performances on various VDU tasks in terms of both speed and accuracy. In addition, we offer a synthetic data generator that helps the model pre-training to be flexible in various languages and domains.</p>"},{"location":"research/2022-10-06-Donut/#key-innovations","title":"Key Innovations","text":"<ol> <li>OCR-free Document Understanding: Donut eliminates the need for separate OCR processing, addressing issues of computational cost, language/domain inflexibility, and error propagation.</li> <li>End-to-End Transformer Architecture: The model uses a simple but effective Transformer-based architecture with a visual encoder and textual decoder.</li> <li>Synthetic Data Generator (SynthDoG): A flexible data generation tool that enables pre-training for multiple languages and domains.</li> <li>Simple Pre-training Objective: Uses cross-entropy loss for next token prediction to learn reading text from document images.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"research/2022-10-06-Donut/#methodology","title":"Methodology","text":"<p>Donut consists of a Transformer-based visual encoder and textual decoder.
